**By Venerable Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka Thera**

It came to mind—suddenly I see this book and I feel the things people
are going through. For me, it is very much about reality, about real
life and what is happening to them. I hope this will play a part in
removing their suffering. Otherwise, no point, you know?

Bhante's gone. I will be gone. All things pass away. Meanwhile, these
teachings should help suffering go away.

My hope is that they inspire people to read the *Suttas*. Or protect the
*Suttas*, maybe some good monastics, or some lay people become
monastics. As lay people they will have more good supporting karma
(accumulated merit). Then they will put effort and more people will find
the right way. This whole thing will help, otherwise what’s the point?

That's why Buddha became Buddha. It should help their liberation, and
others' liberation too.

Before going to the higher Himalayas and the deep jungles of Sri Lanka,
I'd entrust these notes to an immediate attendant—to hand over to a
specific devotee in case I didn't return. They moved through different
hands during this time. Finally, when I wanted to get them back to give
to you all—they were missing. My heart sank. I felt some attachment,
some concern. I felt sorry that people wouldn't get this opportunity,
these ideas. Finally, we found them—inside another cover.

Ultimately, I was waiting for a time when I could give the proper
respect to Bhante. The book is one. The other is the running of the
monastery, meditation retreats, ordinations and the wider spreading of
the Dhamma.

This (book project) gives people a chance to follow the teachings and
make them available to others. If it doesn't happen now, the opportunity
is lost.

In some sense, I can see it has already happened—all of those involved
in these projects. In that sense, I'm really free. Free in the sense
that a weight has been lifted because there’s nothing I can regret.

How do I know? It’s that I don’t get the slightest thought about the
past in regards to my duty.

Venerable Ñāṇavimala contributed so much to my spiritual path. Through
him I received the living Dhamma—the noble vision that I could not have
found on my own. For others who did not have that opportunity, this work
will be a service for the future.

When I hold this (notes and reflections presented in this book), I feel
the spirit of Venerable Ñāṇavimala.

I hope all of this helps people strive and be freed from suffering.

It's a short, fleeting moment. These things will also pass away.

*Bhikkhu Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka*

*\[Editor’s Note: This foreword was adapted from Venerable Bambalapitiye
Gnanaloka Thera’s spoken reflections and was refined with his direct
guidance for clarity and flow. The meaning and tone remain entirely
his.\]*

**Introduction**

“To tell you honestly, some interesting things happened to me” Venerable
Gnanaloka said, looking up from the pages. “I was getting very strong
emotions on occasions, you know. I was seeing... like... seeing myself
on very key occasions, where I am... meeting Bhante.”

He paused, searching for words.

“Which I don't recall like that.”

For over two decades, Venerable Gnanaloka has practiced not holding onto
memories. His teacher, Venerable Ñāṇavimala—whom he addressed as
"Venerable Sir," later "Bhante"”—trained him in the art of living in the
present. Memories, left unattended, don't arise—even memories of his own
life.

But when he read the third draft of the Reflections in this book—stories
of his teacher woven from multiple sources: his own notes from 25 years
earlier, existing literature, his public talks, and our conversations
with him—something broke through. Not just images, but *presence*. “Very
key occasions” returning with such clarity that he was seeing them
again.

We asked him what he meant. What was it about these stories?

“I don't recall him in a sentimental way,” he said carefully. “But if I
put a focus on that…” The precise word remained unuttered, but the
implication was clear. "It touches a very core part of my heart."

It was in that moment we understood: This book needed to exist.

For seven years, a young man named Shanaka kept notebooks filled with
his teacher's words. He began in 1994, during his first solo retreat,
and continued until 2001, even after his own ordination as Venerable
Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka (Ñāṇāloka) Thero.

The notes trace a complete training: how to live ethically in daily
life, face desire and attachment honestly, cultivate qualities like
compassion and equanimity, and develop the understanding needed for
liberation. From basic practice to advanced insight, they preserve a
rare, complete transmission of the Buddha's path.

The teacher was Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera. The student, Shanaka,
had seen him before—but it was a chance encounter on a roadside in 1989
that changed everything.

Venerable Ñāṇavimala had come a long way to be standing on that
roadside. Born Friedrich Möller in Germany in 1911, his path to Sri
Lanka had been unlikely—through war, imprisonment, and discovering a
Buddhist text in an internment camp. After ordaining in 1955, he spent a
decade at Polgasduwa Island Hermitage— a tiny sanctuary nestled within a
lagoon, lush with tropical trees and swept by the cooling breeze —before
becoming a *cārikā* bhikkhu, walking barefoot across Sri Lanka for
twenty-five years, traversing the island three times over. He carried
only what the Vinaya permitted: his alms bowl, three robes, and the few
basic allowables needed for survival—including a piece of soap wrapped
in jackfruit leaves. It was said that there was no village in Sri Lanka
his feet hadn't touched.

He was practicing a rare echo of the Buddha's original instruction—a
tradition nearly lost to time. "Wander forth for the welfare of the
multitude," the Buddha had told his first awakened disciples. This
became known as *cārikā*—the practice of wandering on foot without
settling, forming no attachments to place or possession. He taught that
the wise cling to nothing, like a droplet on a lotus leaf—touching but
never sticking. The monk moves through the world the same way—being in
the world while clinging to nothing.

The sight of a monk like this—his presence, his simplicity—provided a
blessing to all who encountered him.

Eventually, the body that had sustained this journey grew frail, and the
walking reached its natural conclusion in 1991. He told the young
disciple that the *cārikā* had been his service to others, performed as
far as his body allowed.

Those who encountered him often found their lives altered. Venerable
Katukurunde Ñāṇananda, whose influential writings on early Buddhism
would be studied worldwide, described him as the “Mahākassapa of this
age”—the Buddha's chief disciple, an exemplary model of the ascetic
practice—telling Bhikkhu Bodhi: "If you want to get a sermon from
Mahākassapa, go see Venerable Ñāṇavimala." Bhikkhu Bodhi, translator of
major Buddhist texts, would note that “he would adjust his Dhamma talk
to meet the other person in precisely the way that best fit the other
person’s needs”, crediting him for shaping his early understanding on
meditation. He also noted that while Ven. Ñāṇavimala exemplified the
ascetic ideal, he cautioned it was not the only model the Buddha
praised.

The late Ven. Ñāṇadīpa, revered for his asceticism, recalled that while
their approaches differed, he was still moved: “Years after he has gone,
I can at times feel greatly inspired by thinking of him.” He noted the
talks he heard from Ven. Ñāṇavimala typically emphasized “the
preliminary parts of the practice.”

Few received the depth of teaching that Ajahn Brahmavaṁso experienced.
Now one of the most recognized Buddhist teachers in the West, he
describes that rare full discourse as “the best Dhamma talk that I have
ever had the good karma (accumulated merit) to listen to!”, recalling
how Ven. Ñāṇavimala “wove quotes from the *Suttas* together with
explanations from his own experience into such symphony of Dhamma.”

Venerable K. Pemasiri, a respected meditation teacher in Sri Lanka,
observed: “There was nothing put on. There was no conceit. One could
honestly say that this person was definitely on the way to Nibbāna (full
enlightenment). There was clearly no doubt about it!”

Despite his influence on a generation of Buddhist teachers, Ven.
Ñāṇavimala himself remained almost invisible. He gave no public
discourses, wrote no books, built no institutions. When he passed in
2005, most of the Buddhist world—even in Sri Lanka, where he'd walked
for decades—barely knew his name.

None of that mattered to him anyway.

Ven. Gnanaloka describes him as embodying a rare combination: the deep
*Sutta* understanding of a Pāli scholar united with the relentless
striving of a hardened forest ascetic. His theoretical foundation came
from studying under Venerable Ñāṇatiloka and Venerable Ñāṇamoli, two of
the first Western monks to master Pāli and translate key Buddhist texts.
This lineage of going directly to the *Suttas* as primary authority
shaped everything about how he taught.

Though fluent in Pāli, the language of Buddhist scriptures, his
knowledge of the local language, Sinhala, remained deliberately
limited—perhaps to stay anchored in the teachings rather than
conversation—and if spoken it was with a heavy German accent. This was
so much so that even local people occasionally couldn't understand him.
Yet once, addressing visiting monks from Wathuravila, he spoke with
unexpected clarity: *"Lankawe Sinhala handuruwata saddawa thiyanawa,
habai, shakthiya madiy"*—Sri Lankan monks have faith, but not enough
energy.

Ven. Gnanaloka recalls asking him how he accessed words he had never
heard him speak, he explained: mindfulness opens access to knowledge
stored across lifetimes.

His simple utterance to those monks was a call to match faith with
effort.

Visitors would watch him meticulously sweeping around his *kuṭi*. His
door was locked most of the time. Most dared not approach him.

Yet those who did approach—arriving with frantic eagerness, carrying
offerings—experienced something unexpected.

In his presence, something would shift. Ven. Gnanaloka describes them as
leaving in a bewildered calm.

It wasn't just what Ven. Ñāṇavimala said. It was that he was completely
present. Each small action—receiving an item, pouring water, adjusting
his robe—done with total attention.

Somehow, that presence became contagious.

Yet it also demanded something. There was an intensity to his focus—a
sharpness that could unsettle those who weren't grounded. Being near him
required maintaining one's own clarity, or the encounter could prove
difficult to bear.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala's final recorded teachings were captured in 2001. The
world has transformed since then—smartphones, social media, infinite
distraction at our fingertips. One might think his teachings about
embracing discomfort, seeking simplicity, doing one thing at a time with
full attention would feel impossibly distant now.

But perhaps that's exactly why they matter more than ever.

Ven. Gnanaloka remembers overhearing when fellow monks would
enthusiastically speak about the new technology of internet, Venerable
Ñāṇavimala would reply simply: "This is also in the sensual world."

In 1996, Shanaka had recorded something in his notebooks—a warning that
reads differently now than it did then:

*"It is sad to say that the essence of the practice is almost lost
everywhere. People are getting more used to living a comfortable life."*

1996\. Before Google. Before Facebook. Before anyone carried the
internet in their pocket. He was already seeing what the world was
drowning in.

Today, Americans check their phones 144 times a day—once every eight
minutes. Modern society has more comforts, more distractions, more ways
to avoid boredom than ever before. A study conducted in France revealed
that adults who use social media heavily have 3 times the risk of
depression and over 3 times the risk of anxiety compared to light users,
with risks rising over time as technology use intensifies.

In an age of constant stimulation, his life poses a question modern
seekers are perhaps too afraid to ask: Are modern comforts truly leading
to real happiness? How can we find stillness in an age of infinite
scroll?

Venerable Ñāṇavimala's profound turning away was not merely a personal
choice, but a rare and authentic expression of his insight into the
Buddha's teachings—the path to escape suffering, not through comforts,
but through wisdom and effort.

And beneath that question lies another one: How do you find the
authentic Buddha's voice through all this noise?

In his course on Early Buddhism, reflecting upon the instance when
Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī - the Buddha’s maternal aunt, foster mother, and the
first ordained nun - came to the Buddha to seek advice, Bhikkhu Sujato,
founder of SuttaCentral and a scholar of early Buddhist texts says:

“*While Mahāpajāpatī (Gotamī) wants to go on retreat, do intensive
meditation, Buddha is not exactly giving her specific meditation
instructions. He is not saying do Ānāpānasati…do this meditation, or
that meditation*”

He identified something telling about the way Buddhism is taught today.

*“In modern Buddhism, when people talk about meditation, they often
focus on details of meditation techniques. In the Suttas we don't find
nearly so much detail about techniques, but a lot more about how you are
living, what is the attitude in your mind, the focus and direction your
mind is taking. These are the things that really matter.”*

When one observes the notes taken by Ven. Gnanaloka in his teacher’s
presence, it becomes clear that this is the exact spirit that Ven.
Ñāṇavimala would guide him.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala was direct and sparing with detail. He would often
prescribe specific *Suttas* or passages, but rarely elaborate on it at
length. Other times he would share a story to inspire or to convey a
certain Dhamma lesson. In meditation, he offered practical suggestions,
yet refrained from outlining fixed techniques.

But being with him was like stepping through a doorway into the Buddha's
way of practice.

During his first retreat with Ven. Ñāṇavimala—then twenty-three years
old and still a layman—Ven. Gnanaloka experienced the power of this
approach. Rather than lengthy explanations, his teacher directed him to
read through key *Suttas*. He gave a captivating explanation on the
conditioned nature of consciousness and what it meant to final
liberation, as Ven. Gnanaloka reflects “It's not like intellectually
pondering on this”, relating how he was trained “we have already had
this habit of applying it to ourselves and looking at it.”

On the last day of that retreat—the fourteenth day, a full
moon—something broke through.

“I will never forget that day,” Ven. Gnanaloka says. “That was the time
I really felt I had faith in Bhante. I also felt: these *Suttas*, 2,600
years old—these are the real teachings. From our level of defilements,
our interpretations have come.”

The importance of the *Suttas* revealed itself “that was the first
occasion where from the *Suttas* I had a perception of Dhamma.” Adding
that “That was enough to inspire me to know that the Buddha is alive in
these teachings. As well as to know that this could be the end of our
journey. There is nothing else to do.”

Ven. Gnanaloka recalls those days fondly. Being alongside his teacher,
he felt an almost kindred connection. “I saw us like comrades in
battle,” he says. A spiritual battle.

He began to understand that true understanding of the *Suttas*
transcends intellectual study—it requires direct experience. These
insights arise naturally in moments of quiet contemplation, when the
mind is relaxed and free from expectation, whether reading a few words
of the Buddha or contemplating a single teaching.

In 2005, Ven. Gnanaloka was staying in a cave in the hills of Badrinath,
a sacred valley sealed off by towering Himalayan peaks. Each day, he
would walk eight kilometers down the mountain for alms, then eight
kilometers back up. He was having difficulties—a foreigner near the
China border (Tibet region), permissions uncertain.

With the rains retreat approaching and needing to find a place to
settle, an attendant devotee invited him to join a pilgrimage north. He
left his bowl and extra robe behind and set out. Only along the way did
he discover the route led to Leh, Ladakh—and he remembered he could
contact a monk there. A senior monk named Bhikkhu Sangasena welcomed him
to stay for the rains.

During his time in Leh, he confessed something to Bhikkhu Sangasena: “I
feel I will not meet Venerable Ñāṇavimala again.”

A few days later, descending from the monastery with an attendant
devotee to make a phone call from a booth in town, he received the news.
His teacher had passed away. The funeral was already over.

There was no grief—his practice had long ago released such attachments.
Only profound gratitude. His teacher had given him everything that
mattered: direct access to the Buddha's teachings, and the living
example of how to practice them.

Several months later, he was invited to the stupa consecration ceremony
of Ven. Ñāṇavimala. A crowd of about a couple hundred gathered. At
Parapaduwa Island Hermitage; an island hermitage adjacent to
Polgasduwa—they expected him to speak—to share memories, to eulogize his
teacher. Even his parents, present in the audience, encouraged him to
say something.

But he refused.

“I was very serious,” he recalls. “I didn't want to be in the public
eye. It was very personal for me—Bhante, my guru. Even the notes were
very personal for me. I was waiting for that time, when it could be
passed on.”

Instead of speaking, he quietly went and worshipped where the ashes were
kept. And in that silence “I made a vow” he says.

*“Though I'm not going to say anything now, in a hundred-fold I will
help them, give them the teaching.”*

This book is the second flowering of that vow.

Something had been pulling him forward long before. When asked decades
later why he'd felt compelled to record everything, he paused. A long
pause.

"Somehow, I knew it was precious," he said finally. "Even then, I didn't
quite know why—only that it had to be preserved."

He had simply acted—reached for the notebook again and again without
asking why. Some instinct beyond language, beyond decision. It felt as
if it had a destiny beyond his own understanding.

When we first proposed creating this book, Ven. Gnanaloka's response was
immediate: “Let it be anonymous. Release the notes.” He insisted the
focus should be on his teacher.

For an ascetic monk who had spent three decades cultivating
self-effacement, the idea of a book bearing his name contradicted
everything he'd trained for. “I am training to dismantle this idea of
self,” he would say—not to perpetuate it. But we had a problem: the
notes alone—concise, sometimes cryptic, written in the shorthand of
direct experience—couldn't reach beyond those already deep in practice.

To serve wider audiences, they needed context: the spirit in which they
were spoken, the question that prompted them, the life that gave them
weight. They needed his voice, his memories, his stories.

Which meant he couldn't remain anonymous.

Eventually, he agreed—not for himself, but for the teachings. For his
teacher's legacy. For the vow he'd made.

The work took nearly two years. Meeting him was no easy matter. As an
ascetic, he moved between an undisclosed location and Sri Sambuddha
Ramaneeya Ashramaya Forest Hermitage—nestled in forest surrounded by
villages. Evening meetings with devotees and young monks would often run
late. We learned to wait.

When we finally did meet—a little over ten times over those two years—he
was remarkably generous with his time. Sessions would begin near
midnight and continue until three or four in the morning. The world was
silent. His recollections, perhaps even sharper at night, ranged freely.

We'd read him his own notes, written decades earlier. Stories spilled
out—details that hadn't made it into the original entries, moments he'd
forgotten, teachings that needed the context of place and time to make
sense. **These became the reflections that accompany the notes in this
book—the stories behind the teachings, the moments that gave them
life.**

His public talks—which we'd studied closely—were measured, each word
like a mindful step. But here, in person what was expressed was deeper.

Months into the process, during one such late-night session, he said
something that stopped us.

“Sometimes when I read,” he began carefully, “I was in tears actually.”

He explained: “I don't go back to memories of those experiences. I am
not trained to go back to those memories that much. It's a big strain
for me. If I want to, maybe I have to specially make an effort.”

But the book had done what his own will wouldn't—it brought him back.

“It brought me to those feelings of *saddha*—faith,” he said. “I'll
never forget. And it's very clear. Bhante's talking of the same points,
especially now when I'm reading—the same way.”

He paused, then added something we hadn't anticipated.

"I was also doubtful—did I tell the exact details?"

We understood then what it meant to be entrusted with something
precious.

Ven Gnanaloka would sometimes tell us as he left Sri Sambuddha Ramaneeya
Ashramaya Forest Hermitage “don’t think we have much time left.” This
cryptic line often puzzled us, however Ven. Gnanaloka explained. Now
having come of age of fifty four, there is great need for service and
fulfilling of his duty. He would compare his life to the timeframe of a
day, “when you look at it from the perspective of a day, I am
approaching the evening.”

This book was carefully reviewed by a team of eight, including Ven.
Bhikkhu Anandajoti and Mr. Chittapala—both instrumental in compiling
‘*Pure Inspiration: Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera—Recollections of His Life,
Practice and Teaching*s’ and who knew Ven. Ñāṇavimala
personally—together with two other monastic practitioners and four lay
practitioners. The process involved extensive research: reviewing
hundreds of hours of Ven. Gnanaloka’s public talks in Sinhala and
English, studying the *Suttas* referenced in the notes, cross-checking
dates and details, and consulting existing literature such as *Pure
Inspiration*.

As for the writing team, between us we brought nearly fifty years of
meditation practice—one with a background in social research and
conducting interviews, and three with management and senior leadership
experience—deeply influenced by time in Saddhammadhara Sutta retreats
with Ven. Gnanaloka, as well as experience in traditions such as the
Thai Forest, Mahāsi, and Goenka lineages. We weren’t monks or scholars.
We were practitioners. We knew the landscape of practice well enough to
recognize authentic teaching when we heard it.

Venerable Gnanaloka trusted us to help bring these teachings forward—a
responsibility we've tried to honor. Much of this work was done at Sri
Sambuddha Ramaneeya Ashramaya Forest Hermitage during retreats—an
environment of practice that shaped our reflections.

The original notes are Ven. Gnanaloka's, written between 1994 and 2001.
The Reflections—the stories surrounding those notes—are our attempt to
transmit faithfully what we researched and heard in those midnight
sessions.

**Life and Legacy of Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera**

Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera (1911–2005) was a deeply revered yet
elusive ascetic monk who remained almost entirely out of the public
limelight. The unshakeable spirit and wisdom he embodied made him a
quiet legend amongst dedicated practitioners, both lay and monastics.

Born in Germany as Friedrich Möller, one of four children, he displayed
a spiritual inclination from an early age. He grew up in the small
village of Rinteln, near Hannover, in a devout Christian household,
during a time when the Dhamma was not widely known in the West. He
enjoyed sports like athletics and gymnastics—particularly the horizontal
and vertical bars—but felt out of step with the world around him. Even
as a boy, he would slip away to the forest alone, seeking solitude,
neglecting his farm duties. His mother worried about what would become
of such a child.

One time, when asked to slaughter a chicken during farm duties, he found
the experience devastating. That moment left a lasting mark on him, and
he vowed never to do such a thing again. Even then, he seemed to know
that this was not his path.

A chance meeting with an Indian medical student later introduced him to
the Bhagavad Gītā. Its message of compassion and spiritual discipline
resonated with the same tenderness he had shown toward animals. This
awakened in him an aspiration to travel to India.

Leaving Germany was no easy matter however. From 1935, Adolf Hitler’s
consolidation of power began demanding the enlistment of young men in
military service. Though the full wartime draft was not yet active,
Möller, who despised the regime’s militarism and ideology of violence,
needed a way to secure passage out of Europe.

Möller had not qualified for university (the *Abitur*), having failed a
critical requirement — Latin. Instead, he went to Hamburg to pursue
vocational training in business and commercial studies. A few years
before the war began, this training secured him a position as a
stenographer at a Hamburg trading h<span class="mark">ouse—his</span>
narrow passage out of Europe during an increasingly tense time. Ven.
Ñāṇavimala would later remark that his failure to enter university had,
in fact, been his good fortune; had he qualified, he would almost
certainly have been conscripted into the militar<span class="mark">y.
.</span>

The post was initially located in Madras (renamed to Chennai in 1996),
India. He performed his work with utmost capability, enabled by a
concentrative power developed through his personal practice of yoga. He
quickly rose <span class="mark">through</span> the ranks to a top
position. About a year before the outbreak of World War II he was
transferred to Colombo, Ceylon (pre-independence name of Sri Lanka), as
its branch director. This job offered him a pleasant and luxurious life.

But when World War II erupted in 1939, this comfortable life ended
abruptly. Though he had done no wrong, being a German national under the
British colonial rule of Ceylon during that time, meant that he was
classified as an “enemy alien.” Along with other German nationals in
Ceylon, he was interned at Diyatalawa, Ceylon.

As a man in his early thirties, now confined to cell walls, he had to
come to terms with life’s bitter reality—that the comfortable life he
had built was not as secure as he had imagined, and he was powerless to
do anything about it. Through this disillusionment he fell into a
depression. However, a sudden relocation to an Internment Camp in Dehra
Dun, northern India, in 1942, proved to be a hidden blessing. It was
here that the cool breeze of the Buddha’s original words first touched
his heart.

He was placed in the same wing alongside Ven. Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera—the
esteemed German monk who had brought the light of the Dhamma to Europe
and Asia—along with his German disciple, Vappo. Through Ven. Ñāṇatiloka,
Möller discovered his published book, *The Word of the Buddha*, compiled
from the elder monk’s handwritten notes and regarded as his most
influential work.

First composed in German in the early 1900s, it was intended as a
concise yet complete anthology of the Buddha’s actual words, drawn
directly from the Pāli Canon. Ven. Ñāṇatiloka compiled and arranged key
sutta passages in a way that allowed newcomers and scholars alike to see
the framework of the Dhamma. In later years, it was translated into
multiple languages and became recognised as a foundational text for both
Eastern and Western students of Theravāda Buddhism. For Möller,
encountering these words in their pure form during the solitude of
internment, it clicked in him - “this is it.” The wheel of Dhamma began
to turn within him, never to stop.

Repatriated to Germany in 1946, Möller left behind nearly seven years of
internment as an “enemy alien”—a dark period that however forged his
spiritual conviction and direction.

Post-war Germany was a land of ruin and loss—many young men had
perished. Although he had a strong aspiration to go back to
<span class="mark">Ceylon</span> to ordain as a monk, he was deemed
ineligible because he had not been a monk in Ceylon before the war. Ven.
Ñāṇatiloka and other Buddhist monks however were spared the same fate,
and were able to return immediately with the help of increasingly
politically powerful Sinhalese Buddhists and their several
organisations.[1]

Faced with the harsh prospect of rebuilding his life in a devastated
homeland, Möller took <span class="mark">work</span> as a farm
<span class="mark">hand</span> in his village in the countryside near
Hamburg. However, the only remuneration he received here was free food
and lodging. Work was so demanding that he didn’t have any time to
dedicate to practising the Dhamma. Additionally, he had a sensitivity to
the insects he was unintentionally killing whilst ploughing and the
animals he was harming as part of his farm duties. One day he read a
Dhammapada verse: “*Though one should live a hundred years, heedless and
unvigilant, yet better is one single day’s life of one vigilant and
meditative.*” (Dhp 110). This gave him the impetus to leave for
Hamburg<span class="mark">—</span>the “Gateway to the World.” There, he
managed to find work as an English teacher and was able to stay with his
former landlady, who treated him like the son she had lost in the war.

With many German men having perished in the war, the classrooms were
filled largely with women; Möller, however, maintained his physical
distance, as the call of the Dhamma never left his heart. Post-war
Germany was facing a spiritual hunger, a deep yearning to heal, as many
churches also started <span class="mark">re-es</span>tablishing. Möller
was however able to participate in a different kind of support, by
getting involved in *Sutta* discussion classes organised by a local
Buddhist group.

Hamburg had an emerging Buddhist community—part of a post-war spiritual
revival. It also provided the support Möller needed to fulfill his
spiritual resolve. Through his involvement, he managed to meet Asoka
Weeraratna, the visionary founder of the German Dharmaduta Society
(GDS). Möller translated a speech for Weeraratna at a meeting in Hamburg
in March 1953, leading directly to Weeraratna arranging his passage back
to Ceylon to begin his monastic training.

On September 19, 1955, he was ordained as a novice monk (*sāmaṇera*) at
the Island Hermitage on Polgasduwa, a secluded monastery renowned for
its strict adherence to the Theravāda tradition. His full ordination
(*upasampadā*) followed shortly thereafter, with Ven. Madihe Paññāsīha
Mahā Nāyaka Thero—one of the most respected Sri Lankan scholar-monks and
monastic leaders of the 20th century, as his preceptor.

The Island Hermitage on Polgasduwa was a secluded monastery situated
within a lagoon, founded by Ven. Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera in 1911. This
hermitage became a center for serious Dhamma practitioners, particularly
Western monks drawn to the Theravāda tradition, including Ven.
Ñāṇatiloka’s discip<span class="mark">le, V</span>en. Ñāṇapoṇika
Mahāthera, whose later writings would help introduce Theravāda Buddhism
to the West.[2] The monastic training and emphasis on the direct study
of the *Suttas* shaped Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s path, leading him to uphold the
purest form of Buddhist monastic life.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala was the last living disciple of Ven. Ñāṇatiloka, placing
him within a distinguished lineage of Western-born monks dedicated to
reviving classical Theravāda Buddhism. Although Ven. Ñāṇatiloka was the
key influence in guiding him onto the path, it was another resident
monk, Ven. Ñāṇamoli Thera, whom he regarded foremost as a mentor and
source of theoretical guidance. Ven. Ñāṇamoli was <span class="mark">an
English monk</span> renowned for his deep study and translation of the
Pāli Canon, having himself learned Pāli from Ven. Ñāṇatiloka.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala resolved that before teaching others the Dhamma, he must
first directly experience its truth himself.

After 11 years of dedicated practice at the Island Hermitage, he took up
the ancient practice of *cārikā*—walking from place to place as a
wandering monk. This was a profound training in freedom, designed to
systematically break all attachments to places, people, and possessions.
He travelled the island on foot for twenty-five years—from south to
north, east to west—meeting people of all walks of life. His journey was
one of silent blessing; each step was a teaching. To those who met him
on the ro<span class="mark">ad—vil</span>lagers, travelers,
housewiv<span class="mark">es—he</span> offered the chance to give alms
and thus earn merit. Occasionally, with just a few words, he would
deliver profound Dhamma teachings that left lasting impressions on those
who heard them.

He would usually stay no more than three days in one place except during
the <span class="mark">rains</span> retreat. The austere practice he
developed was reminiscent of Ven. Mahākassapa Thera, one of the foremost
disciples of the Buddha. Ven. Ñāṇavimala embodied the similar
asceticism, wisdom and unshakeable detachment from worldly concerns.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala by nature kept to himself. He didn’t encourage
disciples, didn’t build monasteries, and didn’t seek followers. He lived
detached—from people, places, even from his own body.

The physically demanding practice of *cārikā* <span class="mark">over
the years</span> took its toll. After 1987, a hip affliction prevented
him from walking long distances, and he finally ceased his wandering
life in 1991. He then spent four years in Colombo at the Siri Vajirarama
temple before returning to the Island Hermitage in 1995. He later moved
to the adjacent, more secluded island of Parappaduva, where,
<span class="mark">in</span> the last years of his life, he was
bedridden and cared for by dedicated attendant monks.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala became an inspiration for many of the most eminent monks
of his era, who recognized his extraordinary practice and unwavering
dedication to the monastic path. A testament to the reverence he
inspired is powerfully conveyed in Pure Inspiration: Venerable
Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera; Recollections of His Life, Practice and Teachings
(2016), which offers first-hand accounts from monks who, at the time,
were young monast<span class="mark">ics—ma</span>ny of whom went on to
become highly respected senior monks or teachers. These include, among
others, the recollections of the late Ven. Gampaha Pemasiri, late Ven.
Katukurunde Ñāṇananda, the late Ven. Ñāṇadīpa, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ven.
Ajahn Brahmavaṁso <span class="mark">an</span>d Ven. Guttasīla, who
detail<span class="mark">ed</span> their memorable encounters with him.

On October 10, 2005, at the age of 93, Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera
passed away on Parappaduwa Island. At the time of his passing, he was
the oldest and most senior Western Buddhist monk in the world. His
passing marked not an end, but the consummation of a life lived with
radical simplicity—a life that had long since transcended the need for
worldly markers. Today, as many of the forests he once trod have been
claimed by <span class="mark">cultivated fields and</span> concrete, his
legacy lives brightest where his teachings are put into practice: in the
mindful step of a *cārikā* bhikkhu, in the stillness between thoughts,
and in the unwavering return to the Buddha’s original words. For those
who encounter his story, he remains what he always was—a mirror
reflecting the Dhamma’s fullest possibility.

**HOW TO USE THIS BOOK**

**What This Book Is**

This is a window into how the Dhamma was communicated, person to person,
from teacher to disciple. At its heart are the teachings of Venerable
Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera—an ascetic wandering monk of rare discipline and
simplicity—captured in the handwritten notes of his student, Venerable
Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka Thero.

For general readers, this book also offers a collection of
reflections—stories of a disciple's training that show what dedicated
practice looks like, inspiring accounts of the Dhamma embodied in daily
life, and the gradual transformation of a student under his teacher's
guidance. These narratives provide an accessible entry into the
teachings, illuminating the challenges faced, the wisdom offered, and
the lived reality of walking the path.

For practitioners, behind these stories lie the original handwritten
notes—a seven-year training curriculum (1994-2001) rooted directly in
the Buddha's *Suttas*. Preserved exactly as recorded, unfiltered, with
minimal edits only for clarity, they offer complete guidance from
ethical foundations through advanced practice, always pointing back to
the Buddha's words as ultimate authority.

For everyone, this book serves as a gateway—not a destination but a
signpost directing you toward the living source: the Buddha's own
teachings in the *Suttas*.

This book is not a biography, nor an abstract study of doctrine, nor a
comprehensive manual. It is an intimate record of authentic
transmission, offered in the hope that these teachings might inspire
your own direct investigation of the path.

**The Offering**

For two and a half decades, these notes remained private—a way of
remembering the Dhamma as it was lived. They now offer:

1.  A rare lineage preserved — Ven. Ñāṇavimala combined the Sutta
    mastery of a Pāli scholar with the iron discipline of a forest
    ascetic. His approach—rooted directly in the Buddha's
    words—represents an almost-lost tradition.

<!-- -->

1.  A complete training path — From layman's ethical conduct to advanced
    monastic practice, these notes trace a gradual, systematic
    development rarely documented in such detail.

<!-- -->

1.  Inspiration for direct investigation — In the spirit of Ehipassiko
    ("come and see for yourself"), this book serves as encouragement to
    undertake your own study of the *Suttas*, which remain the ultimate
    authority.

<!-- -->

1.  A glimpse of what is possible — Ven. Ñāṇavimala's profound austerity
    exemplifies the Dhamma's highest capacity—not as a requirement for
    all, but as a measure of what becomes possible when renunciation is
    perfected.

**The Structure**

Each chapter contains two parts:

**Notes**

Ven. Gnanaloka's original records from 1994-2001. The discourses
themselves were brief—often lasting only fifteen to thirty minutes—but
carried weight that lingered long after. After each meeting, during
retreats stretching weeks or months, he would write down what he could
recall in his own words. Some had to be recopied as the originals,
battered by sun, rain, and long journeys, began to disintegrate.

These notes capture teachings in the concise language of direct
experience—often brief and direct, even abrupt and as they were written
in the language of direct experience.

These are the core instructions—treat them as direct curriculum.

Edits were made only to correct grammar and sentence structure for
readability. In a few instances of ambiguity, minor word adjustments
were made to convey the intended meaning, always after direct
consultation with Ven. Gnanaloka. All *Sutta* references, bracketed
editor's notes \[like this\], and footnotes have been added for clarity.

Wherever the original notes contained words or phrases in ALL CAPS,
underlining, or an asterisk (\*), we have rendered them in **bold** in
this edition to preserve the writer’s emphasis—signalling points
regarded as especially significant or relevant.

**Reflections**

Stories and context illuminating the notes, developed from Ven.
Gnanaloka's public talks, retreat teachings, and interviews. These
provide the atmosphere of practice under Ven. Ñāṇavimala—the questions
that prompted teachings, the impact on a devoted student, and bridges
connecting scattered notes into coherent narrative.

**The Teaching Progression**

For decades, these notes remained private—a way of remembering the
Dhamma as it was lived.

Read in sequence, they reveal the gradual unfolding of a disciple’s
training under a noble master. At first, Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera directed a
young man—unfamiliar with the Buddha’s teaching—towards The Word of the
Buddha by Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera. From this foundation, he encouraged
Shanaka to live as a good layman: to observe thoughts, words, and deeds,
to care for his parents, and to fulfill everyday duties.

As the training deepened, the advice turned toward facing sensuality and
relationships, exposing the dangers of attachment and the illusion of
security in worldly life. Alongside this, the Mahāthera introduced
meditation—beginning with mettā, mindfulness of breathing, and
Satipaṭṭhāna—always grounding practice in sutta study. He guided Shanaka
through the cultivation of the enlightenment factors, warning against
the temptation of chasing attainments instead of patiently developing
the conditions for wisdom.

In time, the emphasis shifted toward monastic training. The notes
reflect encouragement to prepare for ordination, to learn the
step-by-step discipline of a bhikkhu, and to balance study with
practice. Later still, the guidance moved into advanced teachings such
as the nature of consciousness, and vigilance against Māra’s subtle
snares.

The record is not continuous. Some notes were never written down.
Natural gaps arose when Shanaka was abroad—studying at university in
Cyprus, working in Colombo, on solitary retreats, or during long periods
in India and the Himalayas. What remains, however, carries the full
weight of the teaching and traces the outline of a training both
personal and timeless.

**How to Read**

**For Serious Practitioners**

Read the Notes carefully as direct curriculum, then use Reflections for
context and inspiration. Treat this as a training manual. Test teachings
in your own practice. Return often—let understanding deepen over time.

**For Those New to Buddhism**

The Reflections can be read on their own as inspiring stories—a gentle
introduction to the path. They offer glimpses into what dedicated
practice looks like. When ready, return to the Notes for deeper study.

**For Everyone**

- Read slowly. Don't rush. Let teachings settle.

- Read contemplatively. This is not an academic text to analyze but a
  source for quiet reflection.

- Return often. Meaning unfolds over time and through practice.

- Follow the Sutta references. The notes constantly point to the
  Buddha's words—these are the living sources from which all authentic
  Dhamma flows.

**On Translation and Language**

The Reflections were developed from sources in both English and
Sinhala—Ven. Gnanaloka's recorded talks, retreat teachings, and
interviews as well as literature such as Pure Inspiration. Where
appropriate, quoted remarks have been translated from Sinhala, combined
from multiple instances for clarity, or slightly adapted for
readability. The original meaning and spirit have been carefully
preserved.

This book aims to be both authentic to the source and accessible to a
broad audience. At times, this meant expressing certain Pāli terms and
subtle scriptural meanings in simpler language. While some nuanced
details may not be immediately apparent to readers unfamiliar with the
original terminology, this approach bridges the gap for newcomers while
preserving the essence of the teaching.

On Pāli terms: You'll encounter many—the language of early Buddhist
scriptures. Most are explained in context. A comprehensive Glossary at
the back provides reference for all terms.

**Using the Appendix**

The Appendix is organized for different levels of practice and
commitment:

**For Lay Practitioners**

Curated teachings on ethical conduct, generosity, and meditation
suitable for household life.

**For Monastics**

Comprehensive curriculum addressing training for those who have gone
forth.

**Walking Contemplations**

The precise sequence Ven. Ñāṇavimala would verbalize during *caṅkama*
(walking meditation)—rare insight into a master's moment-to-moment
practice.

**Path to Nibbāna**

A specific, step-by-step sequence Ven. Ñāṇavimala described as leading
to liberation, preserved exactly as given. This direct curriculum
reflects decades of lived practice distilled into essential guidance.

**Complete Sutta List**

All *Suttas* mentioned throughout the book for deeper study.

**This Book as Gateway**

View this as a guide pointing to the ultimate source: the Buddha's own
words. Keep these texts close while reading:

- The Connected Discourses of the Buddha (Saṃyutta Nikāya)

- The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha (Majjhima Nikāya)

- The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha (Aṅguttara Nikāya)  
  (All translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi)

- The Word of the Buddha by Ven. Ñāṇatiloka Mahāthera

May this book serve as a humble signpost pointing toward liberation.

*<span class="mark">Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera on piṇḍapāta (alms-round)
near Siri Vajirarama Temple, Colombo. His quiet presence halted a young
Shanaka—an encounter that would shape the course of a life (circa
1990s).</span>*

**Prologue**

Sometimes a single encounter can alter the course of an entire lifetime.
For Shanaka Dharmakeerti—later ordained as Venerable Bambalapitiye
Gnanaloka Thero—that moment came on a quiet street in Colombo in 1989.

He was a teenager visiting his grandmother in Bambalapitiya, near Siri
Vajirarama Temple, when she invited him to offer alms to a foreign monk
who had come to their house on *pindapāta* (alms round). While she
stepped into the kitchen, Shanaka remained standing beside the monk. A
stillness emanated from him. A quiet light. The young man could not step
away.

This was Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera—wandering ascetic, a noble
saint, and a rare embodiment of the Buddha’s path in its purest form.

Shanaka could not have known then that this meeting would mark the
beginning of a lifelong spiritual apprenticeship.

At the time, he was far from any traditional Buddhist influence. At
fourteen, he had moved with his family to Lesotho, Southern Africa,
where his mind became absorbed in the vastness of physics. Like many
young people passionate about science, he was convinced that its laws
alone held the key to revealing the ultimate nature of reality. By
eighteen, while walking along the Caledon River, he experienced a deep,
powerful recognition of impermanence—a moment so vivid it tilted his
life toward solitude and contemplation. It left him with the bold, naïve
conviction that he was his own teacher.

He was still carrying that conviction when he stood beside the monk in
Bambalapitiya.

Days after their first meeting, fate intervened again. In Panadura Town,
Shanaka saw a monk walking barefoot under the midday sun—robes weathered
from the road, carrying a walking stick. His slight frame somehow held
the presence of a giant. It was the same foreign monk—Venerable
Ñāṇavimala. Stopping his motorbike, he offered to bring a bottle of
‘SMAK’ fruit drink. The monk looked at him with eyes that seemed to see
far beyond the surface and said:

“This is not what we expect from you; we want you to follow this path as
well.”

The words rang through him like a struck bell. He had never spoken of
his spiritual leanings to the venerable, yet here they seemed to be laid
bare.

They sat together on the roadside. Shanaka spoke of his experiences of
perceiving impermanence, weaving them with his knowledge of physics and
philosophy. Ven. Ñāṇavimala listened in silence before quietly saying:

“This is also in the mind.”

The sentence cut through every layer of self-assurance. What he had
taken to be profound realisations were seen for what they
were—experiences of the mind. At that moment, the ground shifted. A
knowing emerged: he had found his teacher.

Two days later, he returned to Siri Vajirarama Temple and shared more of
his experiences. Ven. Ñāṇavimala listened and said:

“Read the *Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta*, and everything will be okay.”

From then on, Shanaka began reading the *Suttas* earnestly, seeing them
not just as texts for study but as subjects for contemplation, shaping
his practice around them even while pursuing his studies. Yet, while
working towards a degree in Business Studies in Cyprus, his practice
weakened and even keeping sīla became difficult. By the time he was
twenty-three, the spiritual calling had grown too strong to ignore, and
he returned to Sri Lanka.

Hearing that his teacher was at Polgasduwa Island Hermitage, he went to
seek blessings before leaving for a self retreat at Athdalagala forest
monastery. Instead, Ven. Ñāṇavimala quietly offered:

“There are empty kuṭis here.”

It was a rare invitation to practise under his direct guidance. The
abbot, however, refused to allow a layperson to stay at the monastery,
seeing only a young man in jeans and a T-shirt. But Shanaka was
unwilling to let the opportunity slip away. Inwardly, he resolved to
live outside the island under a tree, to walk for alms in the village
with a plastic bowl, and to visit the hermitage for his teacher’s
guidance.

As Shanaka walked back behind Venerable Ñāṇavimala, heavy with
disappointment, Ven. Ñāṇavimala turned gently toward him and said:

“There may be some *kamma* behind it.”

Ven. Ñāṇavimala advised him to obtain a letter of approval from the
Mahānāyaka Thero[3] at Maharagama Siri Vajiragnana Dharmayathanaya. The
letter was granted by Venerable Madihe Paññāsīha Mahānāyaka Thero—who,
five years later, would become his preceptor. With the letter in hand,
Shanaka returned to Polgasduwa and was finally allowed to stay.

In 1994, during his first retreat there, he experienced a deeper
intuitive connection—not with contemporary forms of Buddhism, but with
the Buddha who had walked the earth more than two and a half millennia
before. Through the *Suttas*, he felt close to that timeless presence,
and in Ven. Ñāṇavimala, he perceived not merely a person, but a living
embodiment of the Dhamma itself. Every two days, he sat before Ven.
Ñāṇavimala, receiving words as rare as they were illuminating, each
pointing him back to the *Suttas*. Days were spent in the library
reading the texts his teacher recommended, contemplating and meditating
on them.

At night, under the dim glow of a kerosene lamp, he carefully recorded
each instruction—knowing he was preserving something precious. Those
notes, guarded for decades, are now offered here. They are not simply
records; they are the living current of a master’s guidance encouraging
a seeker towards the original *Suttas*, capable—if one listens
closely—of altering the course of a life.

- When there are disturbances, go one step below. Read the *Suttas*.

- Don’t delay. Make use of the situation. A letter might come, or maybe
  sickness, or maybe an outside condition that might make you leave.

- Fasting is good \[from\] time to time to get rid of cravings for food.
  It is good to avoid certain foods that are attractive. Fast one day
  and eat one day. Fast two days and eat two days. Fast three days and
  eat three days. Fast four days and eat four days….five days and so on.

- This will be helpful, especially when one is going on piṇḍapāta.
  Sometimes you might not get any food.

- “Ah happy do we live, we who have no impediments. Feeders of joy shall
  we be even as the gods of the Radiant Realm” (Dhp 200)

- When drowsiness comes, use one of the techniques said to Mahā
  Moggallāna—*Pacalāyamāna Sutta* (AN7.61; dozing).

- Avoid everything that increases *lobha, dosa and moha* because it will
  bring suffering. Do the things that will reduce *lobha* (greed)*,
  dosa* (hate) *and moha* (delusion); it will bring happiness.

- Always, the world is there to attract you.

- As a layperson, it is a must to observe *sīl* on *poya* days[15]. Time
  to time it is good to retire for a couple of days.

- Due to *kamma* one would get a teacher. Some teachers would tell you
  to read the *Suttas*, learn *Pāli*. That is if you decide to be a
  monk. But make sure you do not take any decision without the liking of
  your father.[16]

- The things that disturb—these things will be there throughout life.
  They are *kamma*. Surely, we have done *akusala kamma* before. What
  you must do is direct the mind slowly in that given condition to turn
  towards the goal. You have to consider.

- If one doesn’t have great understanding, one must think how one has
  endlessly roamed in *samsāra.* See *Anamatagga Saṁyutta* (SN 15;
  connected discourses without discoverable beginning). In order to
  refrain and arouse great energy to practice on the path, in whatever
  condition however unsuitable it may be. Never to deviate from the
  path, always sticking to it. Seeing the danger.

- Always, suitable conditions would not remain. That will be the
  situation throughout life.

- *Dhammapada—*there is advice in it for all situations.

- Surely, we would not last. These Aranyas would vanish. The buildings,
  all these things are artificial. The *sāsana* is declining.[17]

**24 March 1994**

- When unwholesome thoughts arise, try to subdue them mentally. Example:
  by *asubha saññā* \[perception of unattractiveness\]*,* or, if it
  doesn’t work, try reading the *Dhammapada* and practice to remove the
  cause of this. Generally, it is due to ignorance, things that are
  impermanent, and which are not yours.

- **Say you were a businessman, and that you did your business rightly
  and justly, for birth to take place consciousness is required.**

- When his body becomes old and when it comes to its end, it cannot
  continue. It needs another body to continue; therefore, it is born
  where necessary conditions would be available (a family that would
  give necessary encouragement and he will grow up to do business).
  Consciousness needs an object to arise.

- If one makes an effort and rises to a certain sphere, one would
  experience the object in that sphere. The effort you make is *kamma*.

- Your object of meditation is the presently arisen consciousness and
  the components constituting that framework, that is past *kamma*[18].

- At the moment of *lokuttara sammā-diṭṭhi* \[supramundane right view\],
  when *nibbāna* \[the unconditioned; the cessation of greed, hatred,
  and delusion\] is an object, one firmly establishes in past
  formation[19].

- **Read *Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta* (MN9; right view).**

**28 March 1994**

- For the mental factors to arise, this body comes to be, with its
  unique nature and functions, such as the in-and-out breathing etc.

<!-- -->

- Must not expect any vision of Dhamma but just create the conditions
  like sīla and so on. Know that every perception even of Dhamma is
  impermanent, sticking to nothing that is connected to impermanent
  elements.

- If something or an activity is unpleasant, look at it as impermanent,
  not yours, and due to *kamma*, do not be displeased.

- In and out breathing, and the perception arising due to the mind
  element, the process taking place due to our past *kamma*. The body
  and body process have come to be, the way it is, based on past craving
  and ignorance.

- **And one cannot delight in the breath for it is impermanent and it is
  not yours.**

- Everything is conditioned.

- Mustn’t try to reason out things that are said to be unthinkable by

  etc.

- **Must stick to facts.**

**1 April 1994**

- Read *Majjhima* 13,14—“quite good” - *Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta* (MN13;

- Read *Majjhima* 117 too—*Mahācattārīsaka Sutta* (MN117; the great

  Ven. Narada and Ven. Kassapa\]

- *Sutta Nipāta*, *Vijaya Sutta* (Snp1.11; victory over fascination with
  bodies)

- Stick to the facts. See things as they are. Bring the mind under
  control. When meditating on the breath, if the mind strays to any
  object, know that it should be brought back to the breath. The senses
  delight in and search for happiness generally. In general life, we
  avoid unpleasant things and get attached to pleasant things, this is
  done even in meditational experience. So, you must always stick to
  *Satipaṭṭhāna*.

<!-- -->

- Generally, we see the body as pleasant, which is an illusion. The
  actual perception is impurities.

- Sexual urges should not be suppressed, but by constantly perceiving
  the impurities of the body, must make the urge subside.

- Must take all sounds, even mental sounds as distractions and must
  stick to things as they are: the breath. Must stick to facts.

- Must concentrate on the in breath and out breath. The whole body
  means, the whole body of breath. Calming the body means calming the
  process of breath.

- We are always either living in the future or in the past.

- Must stick to the present situation and investigate and see the
  situation as it is or the reality of it.

- When practicing mindfulness of breathing, at that time when certain
  feelings arise, observe them carefully, see things as they are, and
  investigate how they arise, the senses. Thoroughly reflect their
  impermanence, the nature of not belonging to you.

**12 April 1994**

- Taking part in Sinhalese New Year is only a convention. It is better
  to spend that time striving on the path and that merit could be
  transferred to relatives. For the wishes of the people who are pure
  and striving resolutely on the path are effective.

- Maintaining equanimity is very important, and developing and
  cultivating it, so that there is no more forming or constructing of
  rise and fall, with intentions, efforts and craving.

- Commentaries are useful; the *Suttas* that strike you very much, go
  through them again and again. But all of them have the same principle.

- Must do what your parents say so that you would not have remorse
  later.

- Not mentally expecting any particular vision or something. It is
  continuously observing the real situation. *Satipaṭṭhāna*\* (breath
  also one should not imagine but should grasp what actually is).

- When you are in retreat, you must continuously try to keep your mind
  not wandering by sticking to the object of meditation or second-best
  thing, reading the *Suttas*. Of course, you have to keep this body
  clean and the dwelling, the surroundings. You may attend to these
  things with full attention mindfully as to what you are doing, when
  finished doing the job, one may come and sit down to meditate and
  reflect carefully of the memory of the last work done, and there is no
  disturbance, then one must think of something or recite which will
  calm oneself quickly, that one has to know, after that one can rest
  the mind on the object of meditation e.g. breath etc. (breath also one
  should not imagine but should grasp what actually is).

- In the beginning it is natural to conceptualize.

**18 April 1994**

- \[Quote from Ven. Ñāṇavimala\] I also had a migraine; it was there for
  some time. To overcome it, I started yoga, and became a vegetarian.
  Nothing worked, but when I entered the Saṅgha, when I looked at it
  from the point of view of Dhamma, it all vanished. There is past
  *kamma*. Have you read anything of Cayce? \[Edgar Cayce\][22]. In a
  dream, it was (consciousness). I got to know the cause of my migraine.
  I was a soldier in the army. I had inflicted pain. Then I knew the
  cause.[23]

<!-- -->

- So don’t worry about these things. Any illness or pain, don’t try to
  overcome it by this action or that which is *Sīlabbata-parāmāsa*
  \[clinging to mere rules and rituals\]. Avoid that which increases it
  (whatever that is unpleasant). Practice of *Satipaṭṭhāna* is very
  effective. Maintain equanimity, let that *kamma* pass on. When that
  past *kamma* is finished, the pain will also be over.

<!-- -->

- **Look at the body as if from outside—the perceptions, consciousness
  and feelings and see them as not yours and therefore maintain
  equanimity.**

<!-- -->

- Keep the mind detached, don’t let the mind be defiled by the pain.
  Make sure you do not act in the present in such a way that pain will
  arise in the future. Make sure all unwholesome activity is avoided.

<!-- -->

- **Try to live as minimally as possible.**

<!-- -->

- Think how the Pacceka Buddhas lived and died at Isigili—*Isigili
  Sutta* (MN116; Isigili: the gullet of the seers). You will show the
  highest gratitude by practice.

<!-- -->

- **Get established in *Satipaṭṭhāna*.**

<!-- -->

- Don’t have any hopes or wishes. Try to cut down any bondage with the
  world of the senses. Be detached from the past, the future and the
  present.

<!-- -->

- **When faced with the world, when one restrains and controls, and
  maintains a certain level of detachment or equanimity, that is *kamma*
  and it will bear its fruits in due course of time. (Food should be
  taken as medicine).**

**21 April 1994**

- For the *sāsana* to last long and prosper, the best service you could
  \[<span class="mark">administer\]</span> is to yourself, properly make
  an endeavor to establish oneself in the proper Dhamma.

<!-- -->

- **But if you try to change or get involved in changing the present
  situation, either the Bodhi pūjās \[worshiping the Bodhi tree\] or the
  conduct of the bhikkhus, even what is left will disappear. So be
  careful, do your own practice in accordance with the word of the
  Buddha, but don’t encourage or assist the wrong practices, in any
  circumstance, it is like swallowing red hot iron balls (using money as
  a bhikkhu etc.)—\[*Aggikkhandhopama Sutta* (AN 7.68; fire)\]**

<!-- -->

- When you go to different established places you should compromise
  according to their rules and regulations, but you must see that they
  are in accordance with the word of the Buddha.

<!-- -->

- **You must observe this (*piṇḍapāta*) with Right View
  (*sammā-diṭṭhi)*.**

<!-- -->

- It is alright if you go on *piṇḍapāta* taking the 8 precepts with the
  white overall. It is good to go to a solitary place on a full moon day
  and observe \[precepts\]. It is good if circumstances permit, to
  observe 8 precepts on the other 4 *Poyas*. Failing that, choose the
  Sunday closest to the *Poya* or whenever there are holidays.

<!-- -->

- **Everyday, you must do things carefully so that, when you reflect in
  the night, you have nothing to regret in regard to the three ways of
  conduct.**

- **When the mind is restless, you may read particular *Suttas* that
  struck you. You may read them over again and again. You may study and
  memorise the verses in *Dhammapada*, that particularly interest you.**

- ***Milindapañha* (Questions of King Milinda)**[24]**: it is alright if
  you read them but accept the ones that are in accordance with the
  *Sutta* and *Vinaya <span class="mark">piṭaka</span>*.**

- **So always stick to the *Suttas*.**

<!-- -->

- The higher rules are there to arouse the *jhāna*. The minor rules are
  not necessary. But when one is directed to purifying the three ways of
  conduct, then the rules are automatically observed.

- You may continue not to eat after 12 o’clock. If it affects the health
  or if you are involved in a lot of work you may eat something small
  (milk or 2 slices of bread). But on *Poya* days, milk is also not
  permitted, water or tea etc. \[can be consumed instead\].

**27 April 1994**

- The seed that you have planted, the tree that you have grown, you must
  look after it, protect it, water it and tend to it carefully. So that
  it will come to full growth with flowers and fruit. Don’t let it be
  destroyed.

- Like a sailor when crossing a river, slowly, not losing the other
  shore, direct the boat slowly, gradually cutting the stream.
  Similarly, you should direct your life.

- Read *Sutta* No. 2 of *Majjhima Nikāya*—*Sabbāsava Sutta* (MN2; All
  the Taints).

- Don’t let the Dhamma seed that you have planted be destroyed. Look
  after it, protect it, and tend to it so that it will grow, flourish
  and bear fruit.

**30 April 1994**

- Always make sure to purify the mind.

- Purified mind brings purified action.

- The Buddha left everything, settled to purify himself and served all
  beings in the highest.

- **Avoid *akusala* \[unwholesome deeds\] even if you have to go through
  hardship.**

- Do things slowly, carefully and mindfully and always watch the three
  ways of conduct and just wait.

- Do *Metta bhāvanā* \[loving-kindness meditation\] and do a bit of
  *Ānāpānasati* \[mindfulness of breathing\].

- Open your eyes.

- Be an example to others. It is a skill, the way one directs everything
  towards Dhamma.

- \[Like\] Nakulamātā and Nakulapitā \[who were regarded by the Buddha

monks’ dining hall to his kuti at Polgasduwa Island Hermitage— though
his body had grown frail with age, his composure and presence reflected
the exceptional mindfulness for which he was revered, steady and
luminous to the very end (circa mid–late 1990s).</span>*

**Reflection 01: Living as an Island Unto Oneself**

Living in close association with Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera often
brought to mind the Buddha’s final instructions to the Saṅgha, as
recorded in the *Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (DN 16)*. Speaking to Venerable
Ānanda shortly before his passing, the Buddha said:

*“Tasmātihānanda attadīpā viharatha attasaraṇā anaññasaraṇā, dhammadīpā
dhammasaraṇā anaññasaraṇā.”*

“Therefore, Ānanda, be islands unto yourselves, be your own refuge,
having no other; let the Dhamma be your island, let the Dhamma be your
refuge, having no other refuge.”

This single instruction seemed to encapsulate the way Ven. Ñāṇavimala
lived. He was beholden to no institution, title, reputation, or
following. His refuge was not in monasteries or teacherhood—it was
solely in the Dhamma.

One day, Shanaka—later to become Venerable Gnanaloka—saw him slowly
making his way back to his kuti. At that time, Ven. Ñāṇavimala was
already well into his eighties. Decades of walking barefoot across Sri
Lanka had worn his body thin. A hip injury sustained in his youth had
worsened with age. He leaned heavily on his cane, walking slowly, each
movement deliberate.

Out of concern, Shanaka approached and asked, “Bhante, can I help you?”

Ven. Ñāṇavimala slowly turned, his eyes calm and bright, and replied,

“This body is not mine—why should I give it to somebody else?”

That response left Shanaka speechless. In just a few words, Ven.
Ñāṇavimala revealed what deep letting go truly looked like—not as a
concept or philosophy, but as lived reality. This was the source of his
unshakeable composure: when the body is no longer taken as ‘self,’ by
means of wisdom its inevitable decay is no longer a personal tragedy.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala never claimed disciples and never sought to build a
following. Yet those who approached him with sincerity found themselves
quietly and often deeply guided.

He would often say: “If anyone is sincere, they will guide you to the
*Suttas*.”

And he meant it. To him, the Buddha was not a distant figure from the
past—the Buddha lived through the Dhamma. The early *Suttas* weren’t
relics but living instructions meant to be practiced. He would often
stress that the teachings are within reach for anyone who genuinely
seeks them.

Although he never took on the title of *Ācariya* (teacher), from the
moment Shanaka met him to the time of his passing, Ven. Ñāṇavimala
offered steady guidance. Sometimes he pointed Shanaka to the *Suttas*;
sometimes, he gave direct advice—often only fully understood years or
even decades later. But more than anything, it was his presence—his
silence, his unwavering commitment to the path—that deeply shaped the
young aspirant’s mind and heart.

In Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s final years, Shanaka had the opportunity to serve
him closely. Through those quiet, unspoken moments, he tried to express
the immense gratitude he felt toward his teacher. But in time, he came
to understand that true repayment doesn’t come through service or
offerings—it comes only by walking the very path that Ven. Ñāṇavimala
had lived so fully.

Though they first met in late 1989, it was not until 1999—after much
hesitation—that Shanaka finally decided to ordain. He felt torn between
two worlds: a strong pull toward ascetic life, and a lingering
doubt—could he truly live a celibate life for the rest of his years?

For nearly three years, Ven. Ñāṇavimala gently encouraged him—never
forcefully. He would sometimes remark, “How great it would be if you
were to ordain.” On another occasion he even went as far to suggest:
“for one year you can ordain, then you can disrobe again.”

One day, hearing his encouragement again, Shanaka responded with
frustration: “The temples are deteriorating, the forest monasteries are
deteriorating, the monks are deteriorating...”

Without missing a beat, Ven. Ñāṇavimala replied,

“Your consciousness is deteriorating.”

The remark landed with striking clarity. Shanaka had no response—just
silence.

And he was right.

Yet, confidence to take the next step did not come immediately.

Sometime later, while on a solitary retreat at Athdalagala forest
monastery in Kurunegala—spent meditating, reading the *Suttas*, and
reflecting quietly—something shifted. The doubts dissolved, and
hesitation fell away. A deep clarity emerged: it was time.

The following morning, Shanaka boarded a bus to Colombo, following the
advice of the forest monastery’s abbot to act swiftly. A part of him
feared that Ven. Ñāṇavimala might pass away before he could ordain in
his presence.

A quarter century has passed since that moment, and now, as Ven.
Gnanaloka, he encounters others who come seeking guidance on entering
monastic life. Even as he guides others, his reverence for his teacher
remains absolute. He reflects that even after decades of intense
practice, he has yet to match the profound wisdom and unwavering
dedication of Ven. Ñāṇavimala. As he often says, “I am but a tiny speck
of dust compared to my teacher.”

Following the example of his own teacher, he does not see himself as a
teacher. Instead, he simply tries to hold space—offering guidance when
needed, and gently pointing them to the *Suttas*, where the true teacher
still speaks.

As the Buddha instructed, the goal is not to rely on others, but to
stand firm—an island unto oneself.

reflections from his time with Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera (1994).*

*Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera reading in the library at Polgasduwa Island
Hermitage. For him, the Buddha was not a distant figure of history, but
a living presence—guiding the earnest practitioner through his words
preserved in the Suttas (circa 1990s).*

*.*

**Reflection 02: Returning to the Source**

When Shanaka first met Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera as a young layman, he
was quietly swept up in the charisma of the elder monk’s presence. There
was nothing overt in Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s manner—if anything, it was
understated and austere. Yet even in his eighties, with a body worn and
frail, there was an extraordinary stillness and alertness in each step.
Every movement seemed to arise from a deep inner silence.

One day at Polgasduwa Island Hermitage, Shanaka stood watching Ven.
Ñāṇavimala walk toward the dining hall. A sense of awe filled him; the
elder monk’s stillness and compassion felt majestic. In that moment,
Shanaka saw him not just as a guide, but as the embodiment of the path
itself—his true teacher.

As if sensing this very thought, Ven. Ñāṇavimala suddenly paused and
turned. His calm, piercing gaze met Shanaka’s eyes as he said:

“Your teacher and my teacher is the Dhamma—Vinaya.”

The words landed with the force of a direct answer, penetrating
Shanaka’s heart and remaining with him for life.

In time, Shanaka came to understand what Ven. Ñāṇavimala was pointing
to. In the world, even the most sincere teachers can mislead—however
unintentionally. Devotion can become entangled with personality,
lineage, or charisma. But the Buddha—the true refuge—never lets one
down. The Buddha made no promises beyond what could be seen and verified
directly. He asked for no blind faith, only careful and honest inquiry.

This very inquiry led him to appreciate the difficulty many modern
seekers face. He began to understand why the Buddha’s words, though
timeless, could feel so distant to modern seekers—and why contemporary
voices often seemed to reach them more easily. The gap wasn’t only time
or culture—it was about resonance. The unadorned power of the ancient
words carried a subtle vibration that minds conditioned by constant
noise struggled to detect. To truly hear the *Suttas*, the mind itself
had to be quieted, re-attuned. He found that stillness first in the
forests, where the primordial silence carried the same quality as the
Buddha’s voice.

Through his practice, he came to see the critical difference. While the
words of modern commentators could be like a reflection of the moon, the
*Suttas* were the moon itself. He affirmed that the *Suttas*
“may<s>-</s>look simple, but they point clearly to that insight.”

He further reflected on the sacred support of places he practised in Sri
Lanka, noting; “where arahants and beings practiced…. We get that faith
and the mind inclines towards that.” Yet he came to see that within its
nature lay only a training ground. The true seclusion the Buddha taught
was internal—a stilling of the mind and a guarding of the senses that
could be accessed anywhere. He would later experience this with profound
clarity in the midst of a crowd of grieving family and relations after
his cousin went missing; even there, the stillness of a guarded mind
allowed the Dhamma to be his refuge.

To Shanaka, it became apparent that the *Suttas* were like a well-lit
path through a tangled forest. They were direct, practical, and
complete. If followed sincerely and attentively, they would lead to
freedom. That moment near the dining hall had not been just a passing
remark—it was Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s way of pointing Shanaka away from
himself and back toward the source. Don’t cling to me—or to anyone. Go
to the Dhamma. Trust the Buddha.

Although Ven. Ñāṇavimala lived as a *cārikā* bhikkhu and never claimed
to have students, many were quietly drawn to him. Even senior monks
sought him out. Their mutual preceptor, Venerable Madihe Paññāsīha
Mahāthera, held Ven. Ñāṇavimala in deep respect. So did venerable
monastics like Bhikkhu Bodhi, Ven. Katukurunde Ñāṇananda, Ven. K.
Pemasiri, Ajahn Brahm, and many others.

Prominent lay meditation teachers also drew great inspiration from him.
During his time at Polgasduwa, Shanaka met individuals such as Godwin
Samararatne, founder of the Nilambe Meditation Centre, and Brindley
Ratwatte, the key figure in establishing Dhamma Kuta, the first Sri
Lankan meditation centre in the Sayagyi U Ba Khin / Goenka tradition.
Both had been inspired by Ven. Ñāṇavimala and had come seeking his
guidance. Years later, Brindley Ratwatte ordained as Venerable
Siddhartha, and Ven. Ñāṇavimala asked Ven. Gnanaloka to support the
newly ordained monk during his early time at Polgasduwa.

Whether they were monastics or laypeople, Ven. Ñāṇavimala never allowed
himself to be elevated or revered as a “guru” or spiritual figurehead.
Though his presence was undeniably compelling, he refused to let
personal devotion obstruct the path. Again and again, he directed others
not to himself—but to the Buddha.

“If anyone is sincere, they will guide you to the *Suttas*.”

That simple line, often repeated by Ven. Ñāṇavimala, was not merely
advice—it embodied the very core of his teaching. It became the
foundation upon which Shanaka, who would later ordain as Ven. Gnanaloka,
built his entire path. It remains the guiding light by which he
continues to live.

The lesson of the encounter was clear. Even the most gifted teachers may
offer invaluable guidance and inspiration, but they can also falter, for
charisma fades, institutions shift, and personalities fail. The only
ultimate refuge, as Ven. Ñāṇavimala himself would say, is the timeless
Dhamma, for ‘the Buddha never lets you down.’

**“The Way You Deal With Your Parents”**

**(Oct 1994 – Dec 1994)**

\[NOTE: Content added by the editor is highlighted in blue/red for ease
of reference\]

**26 October 1994**

- It is good to start the practice early in life (earlier the better).

- You must see in your own self \[the body\] the impurities and how it
  is rushing towards old age.

- When one sees this with full concentration, there is no craving
  (*<span class="mark">paṭiccasamuppāda</span>*). You must also see the
  other bodies with the same destiny and impure nature.

- When you are old, it is difficult.

- Watch over the three ways of conduct[31] and practice *mettā*
  *bhāvanā*, and wait.

- If you have to do a job \[get one\] that will give you enough time and
  is in accordance with Dhamma.[32]

**28 October 1994**

- *Suttas* to Mahānāma. Though they were laymen they attained the path.
  Practice the way it is taught there. *Buddhānussati, Dhammānusati and
  Saṅghānusati* then *Mettā, anicca saññā.*[33]

- As a layman or a bhikkhu, in any case, *Majjhima*
  61—*Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda* *Sutta* (MN61; advice to Rāhula at
  Ambalaṭṭhika).

- *Majjhima* 107, 125 gradually to *jhāna* and the *anicca* of
  that—*Gaṇakamoggallāna Sutta* (MN107; to Gaṇaka Moggallāna),
  *Dantabhūmi Sutta* (MN125; the grade of the tamed).

- *Majjhima* 64—*Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta* (MN64; greater discourse to
  Māluṅkyaputta)

- Word of the Buddha \[by Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahāthera\] (not what is
  mentioned in the commentaries). But follow advice strictly from the
  early Buddhist texts.[34]

- *Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta* (DN 16) (there is a lot of valuable advice in
  it)—*Mahāparinibbāna Sutta* (DN16; the Great Passing).

- Word of the Buddha \[by Venerable Nyanatiloka Mahāthera\] has a very
  good right view (*sammā-diṭṭhi)* in essence. You can practice
  *ānāpānasati* but with Right View (*sammā-diṭṭhi)*.

- Soon as you enter the Saṅgha, there is certain training one has to do
  (new bhikkhus). Venerable Mettāviharī knows the *Suttas* and their
  grouping very well.

<!-- -->

- **Now you are 24, you may have to start an apprenticeship which your
  father would also like. Then before you take up another job or
  anything, take a one year holiday. Then you may visit certain
  *aranyas* and stay for a couple of months and see the practice.**

<!-- -->

- I recommend two *aranyas*, Galduwa and Wathuravila and also Kanduboda.
  They have branches.

- But you must make sure you are given all opportunities to devote fully
  to the practice otherwise impossible to attain to the path.

- If you decide to be a monk after that one year, make sure it is under
  those conditions. Otherwise, it is better to be a layman.

- The Saṅgha may disappear any moment.

<!-- -->

- **If you are a laymen try to join an organization like Red Cross or
  civil service where you can perform action doing merit at the same
  time supporting the body.**

<!-- -->

- If you take up a job in the management field you may earn a lot of
  money and now you are 24 but 25,26,27, these ages you will be
  approached by parents and relatives to have a partner. Here you have
  to make a decision. *\[Personal Note:\]* <span class="mark">I must be
  frank about this \[about marriage\]</span>

- Jotipāla and Ghaṭikāra (MN 81): Ghaṭikāra, he was a layman—an anāgāmī,
  who reached the suddhāvāsa \[*Brahma world*\]. Jotipāla joined the
  Saṅgha, attained nothing at that birth and became an arahant as
  Sammāsambuddha \[Gotama\] before Ghaṭikāra.

*\[Quote from Ven. Ñāṇavimala\]* So I don’t know, these are only
suggestions. You might know a better way.[35]

- At this stage, it is most important to do your studies properly.

- I really don’t know your exact intentions, all this Dhamma knowledge
  etc. (the reverend sir seems to ask “for what”)[36]

<!-- -->

- **All my blessings to your endeavors.**

**29 October 1994**

- How much work you have in the layman’s life, still you should allocate
  certain time for the practice and in any case during *poya*
  \[holiday\] you should take *sīl*. If possible before and after *poya*
  you may retire \[for\] 2 or 3 days at a stretch.

- You need merit, don’t fear merit.

- The Buddha was once asked why he was so powerful? etc. He replied how
  he did *mettā bhāvanā* and how he rose in the Brahma world and how he
  became the *Cakkavatti king* many times as a result of his *puñña
  kamma*.

<!-- -->

- **Learn to experience everything from a distance, as everything is
  *anicca, dukkha and anatta*.**

**30 November 1994**

- Were you free from disturbance from inside and outside. From inside it
  is not possible to be free from stray thoughts. Unless you attain
  *jhāna* where you have one thought.

- To attain *jhāna*, you should be highly *sīlavanta* (virtuous). The
  *Ambalaṭ<span class="mark">ṭhika Rāh</span>ulovāda Sutta* (MN61;
  advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika); in this *Sutta* not only verbal and
  physical, but mental. So, you must purify the mind. It is based on the
  state of mind that one’s physical and verbal actions follow.

<!-- -->

- **Therefore, the mind should be watched as in *Sutta* No. 19 in
  *Majjhima Nikāya*—*Dvedhāvitakka Sutta* (MN19; two kinds of
  thought)*,* and controlled as mentioned in *Sutta* 20—*Vitakkasaṇṭhāna
  Sutta* (MN20; removal of distracting thoughts)**

<!-- -->

- You may read *Khandha Vagga* (SN22; connected discourses on the
  aggregates) and *Saḷayātana Vagga* (SN35; connected discourses on the
  six sense bases).[37]

- and note down striking passages in Pāli. Repeat it and go through them
  slowly.

- When you are a layman, you must make sure to follow what was advised
  to Mahānāma[38].

- *Samādhi: mettā bhāvanā, Satipaṭṭhāna, Cāga*: giving up (even the
  hindrances), *Bahussuta* \[knowledgeable\]: reading the *Suttas* daily
  a bit.

- *Mettā bhāvanā* should be practiced as advised by Ñāṇamoli Thera \[The
  Practice of Loving-Kindness\].[39]

  - You must get *samvega* by reading what is mentioned in the
    *Maharagama Pirith Book* \[*The Mirror of the Dhamma* compiled by
    Ven. Narada and Ven. Kassapa\]

  - *Caturarakkha bhāvanā* \[Four Protective Meditations\]

- If you want to be a bhikkhu, you must really look into your heart.

**25 December 1994**

- Explanation of walking \[meditation\] of Rev. Ñāṇavimala, from the
  kuṭi to dāna sālā (*sati sampajañña*[40]), it is looking at the body
  from outside as if looking at another person, especially the movement
  of the legs and seeing the impermanence in the movement of the legs
  constituted by flesh, bones, and in this way establishing dispassion
  and at other times sitting down to meditate and attain *jhāna*.[41]

- Working is a good idea, because of your concentration you may achieve
  good results in meditation \[and at work\]; and there may arise
  temptation when higher things are offered \[at work\] and at that time
  you must be careful.

- Do not stick to one meditation object, but to eradicate different
  kinds of defilement you should choose \[different meditation objects\]
  and practice.

- Verses in the *Dhammapada* and *Word of the Buddha* are good.

- Practice *mettā bhāvanā*, don’t just wish happiness, but do it in the
  way taught by Ven. Ñāṇamoli \[The Practice of Loving-Kindness\].

- Don’t pray or wish that you should come to this or that, there should
  not be any tension.

- You must meet the teacher and discuss when there is a disturbance of
  thought or such like.

**26 December 1994**

- **Consider the way you deal with your parents when dealing with other
  Godly beings. You must work and do your duty in such a way to get
  their blessing. But do not go for ultimate refuge, as they are still
  in *saṁsāra*. \[You\] must go for refuge in Dhamma.**

<!-- -->

- We have created this situation.

<!-- -->

- **Try to practice this awareness of the body (that is, as if looking
  at it from outside) or as if observing another body, cultivate it or
  practice it as much as possible because at that time you are living in
  the present.**

- **Read, grasp and practice a couple of *Suttas*. Concentrate on
  them.**

<!-- -->

- Don’t try to memorise a lot of *Suttas*, like in the case of a
  scholar. Practice is important.

<!-- -->

- **It is very important, this practice (to reflect on all activities
  during the day and to think over these activities one by one before
  your sleep, then to make determination \[*adhiṭṭhāna*\] to avoid any
  activities you did the previous day that are regrettable).**

> It is good to end the day with *Mettā* *bhāvanā*, after doing
> Buddhānussati \[recollecting the Buddha’s virtues\] and when doing
> *Mettā* *bhāvanā* in the end reflect on the impermanence of that also.

- **Father too will definitely come to understand. He will definitely
  give his deep blessings.**

- **When certain impressions come, when reading or reciting the gāthās
  or *Suttas*, don’t sort of feel, I should immediately go, get there
  and things like that**[42]**. No frustration, wishes and so on.**
  **You must remember that situations change.** So, you should work for
  it in the desired direction continuously and constantly. Like when you
  desire to reach a certain place (Kandy city), simply by wishing you
  would not get there. But if you start moving in the right direction
  and working towards it, stage by stage, you would finally come there.
  It is the same way.

**27 December 1994**

- There should be a good foundation of *sīla* and then *jhāna* and
  *Satipaṭṭhāna*.

- First 10 *Suttas* in *Majjhima Nikāya* leading to final
  liberation.[43]

- Purified mind is followed by purified action. It is important to first
  concentrate on the state of mind then after that other action will be
  all wholesome (first *Dhammapada* verses[44]).

- Read a couple of *Dhammapada* verses daily.

- While attending \[to\] normal activities, it is not possible to attain
  the *jhānas*. But when you practice *sati* or awareness, then when the
  time for sitting meditation, it is more supportive to attain the
  *jhānas*.

- When you practice this awareness of the body (that is looking at it as
  if another body) and the things that constitute the impurities, then
  there is a turning away of the mind from the body (dispassion), then
  due to this a certain feeling of peace may arise. Now one must
  understand the impermanence of feeling and should not accommodate any
  craving for it. When one does that clinging (*upādāna*), existence
  (*bhava*), birth (*jāti*), old age, sickness—all this is not there
  (*paṭicca samuppāda*).

- But to do all this one must build a sound foundation of *sīla*.

- Don’t think about what to do in the future or how to act because all
  situations change. When the time comes, consider and decide.

**28 December 1994**

- Must make sure there is a good basis for *sīla*, for the Dhamma
  building to be constructed.

- One cannot always be in meditation or *jhāna*. But when one is
  attending to other work like moving about, one should establish
  oneself in mindfulness as much as possible and it becomes the most
  wholesome condition to attain the *jhānas* when one sits down to it.

- One should establish three ways of conduct and should reflect every
  evening, before sleeping any activity that is regrettable, that which
  should be avoided the next day and so on. It should continue day after
  day. This practice should be put into effect without delay.

- Then one practices *Satipaṭṭhāna* to overcome the hindrances, and then
  attains the *jhānas*. Afterwards one turns away from that as well,
  that is when one enters the path.

- Know you have a theoretical grasp, but experience is important. You
  must experience it.

- Whenever there is a decision to be made and you do not know what to do
  then you should practice *Mettā* *bhāvanā* before you sleep and then
  think about the ultimate goal you want to achieve, and the decision
  you have to make and then you can fall asleep. In the morning you
  would get the answer.

- Normally, reasoning out is not correct. This way it is more reliable.

- **In a nice appealing fashion, someone may appear (maybe the wife in
  the past lives), you must know that this is Māra**[45]**.**

- But when you practice *Satipaṭṭhāna* it is quite safe. Don’t worry
  about anything. Every moment should be \[a\] pleasant abiding.

- You must be one with the *Mahāsaṅgha*, not considering an individual,
  then though we are separate in body, we will be one in mind.

*At a Previous Discussion*

- **You must go and stay in a jungle. If you are forced from inside, not
  otherwise. You must see a tremendous need to turn away from the
  *kāma-loka* \[world of sensual pleasure\].**

- **A lot of arahants were near the Himalayan region. This area is
  extremely difficult. This was the reason that many became yogis, to
  escape from the *kāma-loka*, because there is nothing pleasant in this
  outside world of five senses. So, they turn away inwardly.**

*After a decade of close association with Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera,
Shanaka finally entered the monastic life as Ven. Bambalapitiye
Gnanaloka Thero, with the full blessings of his parents (Siri
Vajiragnana Dharmayathanaya, 19 December 1999).*

## **Reflection 03: The Karmic Bonds That Shape a Path**

Shanaka was born in 1971, during the height of the youth insurrection in
Sri Lanka[46]. At the time, his parents were living in Anuradhapura,
where his father worked as an agricultural engineer. However, his
maternal grandfather—a doctor—insisted that Shanaka’s mother travel to
Colombo and stay with them until the baby was born. According to his
mother, this decision turned out to be a blessing in disguise.

Shanaka came into the world several weeks premature—not in a hospital,
but in the backseat of his grandfather’s car, near a Buddha statue, as
they were rushing to the hospital. His grandmother, overjoyed, is said
to have exclaimed:

“*Mage budu putha ipaduna*” (“My son, blessed as a Buddha, is
born.”)[47]

Though they may have hoped for a saintly child, what they got was a
whirlwind of energy. From his earliest years, Shanaka was rebellious and
intense. When his father’s work later took the family to Kandy, he was
enrolled at Trinity College, a prestigious private school known for its
discipline and refinement. But Shanaka resisted conformity at every
turn. He fought, broke rules, and challenged authority. Bruce Lee became
his hero. Canings at school were frequent, and at home, his mother
struggled to contain his fierce spirit.

Yet one thing stood out, even amidst the chaos: Shanaka’s instinctive
reverence for monks. As a quiet foreshadowing of his later path, at
around eight years old, in an act of childhood play, he and a friend
pretended to be monks, earnestly circumambulating a school tree they
imagined to be a sacred Bodhi tree. It lasted a couple of days. Then it
was back to fighting, back to trouble—the usual boyhood chaos.

His life took a dramatic shift when his father accepted a foreign
assignment in Lesotho, Southern Africa. There, Shanaka’s unchanneled
energy found a new outlet in sports, particularly athletics and cricket.
At the same time, a quiet curiosity about the nature of life began to
emerge. He would often walk alone along the Caledon River, contemplating
questions of time, space, and existence. Albert Einstein became his new
inspiration, and he began to dream of studying at Princeton University.

He was particularly drawn to the theory of relativity—how time slows
down near the speed of light, and how one might, in theory, travel
backward in time. Of course, nothing with mass could surpass the speed
of light, but to Shanaka’s mind, memory itself was already a form of
time travel. During one such walk, a question arose:

“What is the cause of any phenomenon?”

And then, just as instantly, came an insight:

“Anything that begins in time must also end.”

The realisation struck him deeply. He saw that true understanding would
not be found in beginnings and endings, but in the cessation of
time-bound experience. In that very moment, an image appeared in his
mind—a monk, calm, solitary, and detached. A quiet knowing followed:

“I must become like that.”

Everything became clear. This body was temporary. This life, fleeting.
Even his dream of studying at Princeton began to fade. The nature of
impermanence was becoming evident.

When he returned home, he informed his father that he wanted to ordain.
That single sentence sent shockwaves through the family.

From that day on, his once restless and fiery manner softened naturally.
He walked more intently, ate mindfully, spoke less. His mother, who had
a spiritual inclination, supported him wholeheartedly and became his
first student. His father, however, was deeply disappointed. To him, it
seemed as though his son was throwing away his future—his education, his
cricketing talents, and his worldly potential.

Their relationship grew strained. Shanaka knew he had caused pain, and
with time, he came to understand just how difficult it must have been
for his father to accept. But shortly after this turning point, he met
Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera—a meeting that would shift the trajectory of
his life entirely.

Had he not met his teacher, Shanaka might have rushed blindly into
renunciation, creating more conflict and widening the rift with his
father. But Ven. Ñāṇavimala guided him with wisdom and restraint,
offering a principle that left a lasting impression:

“Don’t break your *Sīla*[48] for anyone—not even for your parents. But
short of that, do everything you can to make them happy.”

During one of his retreats, Shanaka had a deep insight into the karmic
ties he shared with his father—why he had been born into that family,
why he was his father’s son.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala encouraged harmony, not defiance. He reminded Shanaka
that parents are not random strangers—they are beings bound to us
through past *kamma*, who have cared for us since birth. Following this
advice, Shanaka chose to honor his father’s wishes. He enrolled in
business management studies in Cyprus and later worked at an auditing
firm for two years.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala once told him:

“You don’t overcome *kamma* by changing the environment—you remain
equanimous and let it pass.”

These words shaped Shanaka’s approach to challenges. Rather than
reacting, he learned to stay centered—to uphold his precepts and let old
*kamma* unfold without adding new layers of conflict.

It would take nearly a decade for Shanaka’s father to give his blessing.
He never argued or pleaded. He simply followed his teacher’s guidance:
he meditated, studied the *Suttas*, and undertook silent retreats—both
in Sri Lanka and later in India—while continuing to support his parents’
happiness.

Eventually, his father began asking him when he planned to ordain.

In 1999, during what would be his final solitary retreat as a layman at
Athdalagala Forest Monastery in Kurunegala, days of meditation, *Sutta*
reading, and quiet reflection brought matters into focus. The
uncertainty about timing eased; the decision to seek ordination became
clear.

This time when he returned home, and informed his father that he wanted
to ordain. His father embraced him and said:

“Son, don’t look back.”

That blessing gave Shanaka strength beyond anything he could have
imagined. Years later, as Venerable Gnanaloka, during a particularly
grueling *cārikā* through the Knuckles mountain range, he became lost
for several days. He fell down a ravine, was stung by fever nettle,
covered in leeches, and had neither food nor water. Some later
speculated that he must have possessed supernatural powers to survive.
But in truth, what sustained him was something much simpler.

A quiet mantra arose in the depths of the forest:

“My father blessed me… My father blessed me.”

That blessing, that acceptance, became his source of strength.

Looking back nearly three decades later, Ven. Gnanaloka sees just how
true his teacher’s words were. Ven. Ñāṇavimala once told him:

“The only way to truly help your parents, your relatives, and all
beings… is to purify yourself. This will inspire others.”

He was right.

The seeds of Dhamma that Shanaka planted over the years bore
extraordinary fruit. His father—once his greatest critic—became his
greatest supporter, and in time, both parents were inspired to enter the
holy life. His father ordained as a monk and passed away as a bhikkhu in
2024. His mother, his very first student, ordained as a nun in early
2025. Their journey is a testament that the call to a spiritual life can
be answered at any age, bringing the family’s story full circle from
resistance to shared commitment in the Dhamma.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s guidance became the living bridge between the Buddha’s
words and Shanaka’s life. The Blessed One had declared that even
carrying one’s parents on each shoulder for a hundred years would not
repay the debt owed to them[49]. His teacher showed him the way to
honour that truth—not through grand gestures or conflict, but through
patient conduct, unbroken *sīla*, and the steady purification of the
heart. In following this counsel, Shanaka found that his ordination was
not a turning away from his parents, but the highest act of
gratitude—one that, in time, inspired them to walk the same path.

  supporting the body, constituted of the 32 parts of impurity, and if
  you vomit it back, it is so repulsive. When it goes from the throat it

  to solitude to purify oneself in order to overcome the ‘I’ conceit and
  thereafter serve in a selfless way.

- A teacher generally has an idea of all the *Suttas*. So, he prescribes
  to the pupil, according to where the pupil is and where he has to get
  \[to\] and it is a step-by-step process.

- If the pupil is a layman and wants to meditate then he should start
  with *Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda Sutta* (MN61; advice to Rāhula at

  etc.

- You must always start with the three protections[54] and with arousing
  of spiritual urgency, when beginning on *caṅkamana*, or any kind of
  *bhāvanā* or spiritual endeavor.

- You must always try to curb and annihilate *lobha* (greed)*, dosa*
  (hate) *and moha* (delusion) by a suitable *kammaṭṭhāna*.

- One cannot rely on anything that is from outside that is
  happiness—only the inner peace.

- *Caṅkamana* is sticking to the present without giving into thoughts
  from outside, this should be done with understanding and reflection of
  the situation of the body, how all activity is centered around
  supporting the impure body that is connected with all kinds of
  suffering—old age, sickness, and all kinds of illusive happiness.

  still in your stomach undigested, and so on. And also, when you are
  taking food, the trouble involved in meeting lay people and just to
  support this body, with people working day and night for a body which
  is rushing to old age, sickness and death. But when you know that, one
  is able to remove the cause of suffering or the arising of this

  practice *mettā* *bhāvanā*. Do the activity with full concentration,
  slowly. And on *poya* days you may retire in a suitable place and
  wait. All depends on your practice.

- When going on *caṅkamana*, see the suffering we have to go through to
  maintain this meaningless process, coming in contact with disturbing
  sense impressions and the food when we are eating, the danger in it

  rushing toward old age, sickness, death, this craving. But one should
  be happy that we know the root cause for this suffering, it is this
  craving.

*Ven. Ñāṇavīra, Ven. Ñāṇamoli, and Ven. Ñāṇavimala at the Island
Hermitage, Polgasduwa — young Western monks who, having seen the horrors
of the Second World War, turned away from worldly life to follow the
ancient path of the Buddha (1955).*

**Reflection 04: Seeing Through the Snare of Sensuality**

The Buddha taught the spiritual seeker to look beyond appearances—to see
the true nature of experience as it is. Beings, he said, are trapped in
an illusion they don’t recognize and don’t know how to break free from.
What the world takes as beautiful, has an inherent foul nature; what it
calls lasting is impermanent; what it delights in as pleasure is bound
up with suffering. Not understanding this duality, one is perpetually in
this suffering loop, never free from it.

For Möller (later Ven. Ñāṇavimala), these words were no longer distant
teachings. They were the shape his own life had taken. The seemingly
secure world he had built in Sri Lanka collapsed overnight, and he was
stripped of all control. From that darkness, the Buddha’s words felt
like a breath of fresh air—a light piercing the fog of illusion. He
began to see for himself the danger the Buddha had warned of: that to
mistake the unstable for the stable is to invite suffering again and
again.

To be free of that danger requires dismantling the web of false
conditioning woven by craving and ignorance. He undertook this with
endurance and clarity—an unrelenting commitment to simplicity,
renunciation, and truth—a striving that would come to define his life as
a monk.

For decades, Ven. Ñāṇavimala wandered barefoot across Sri Lanka,
carrying nothing but his bowl, robes, shoulder bag and other necessary
requisites.[68] He accepted only what was absolutely necessary for
survival<span class="mark">—</span>and even that, sparingly. He once
told Shanaka, “You rest only in hospitals,” a stark reflection of his
own uncompromising resolve. It wasn’t an exaggeration.

Years later, when Ven. Gnanaloka himself began undertaking *cārikā*, he
met doctors who had treated Ven. Ñāṇavimala during bouts of severe
illness. They remembered him staying only until he could stand again;
then, without announcement, he would leave—on foot, alone, with no
destination beyond the next forest or village. For him, rest was not a
right but a concession to necessity, and even then, only briefly
granted.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala would often say that “life, even the life of a bhikkhu
is full of *dukkha*: sickness, old age, and the continuous effort just
to find sustenance.” The body, he reflected, is merely a fragile sack of
thirty-two foul parts. “If one vomited what was consumed, one would
recoil in disgust. Even before it enters the stomach, it is offensive.
Let it sit a day or two, and it rots. Yet the world clings to this
form—this perishable thing—mistaking it for pleasure.”

The flower that delights the eye is already wilting; the skin that seems
radiant today will soon wrinkle and fade. Even delight itself grows
weary with time. What the world praises as beauty is only impermanence
briefly disguised.

Seeing this, Ven. Ñāṇavimala understood sensuality not as something to
chase, but as delusion wearing the mask of sweetness. Reflecting on the
snare of romantic attachment, perhaps the most potent expression of
sensual desire he said:

“Whatever momentary happiness is there, it is a temporary intoxication.
But far more suffering is connected with it.”

He spoke simply, but the truth struck deep.

Desire, aversion, and delusion—these are the fires that keep us bound to
discontent, always seeking, never still. He came to see that freedom lay
not in belief, but in understanding the chain of arising and ceasing—how
every flame of craving depends on its fuel, and when the fuel is gone,
the fire ends.

This clarity had not come overnight. Long before he donned the robe,
even as a young layman in Germany, he had glimpses of it.

Once, there was a beautiful young woman from his hometown who was
devoted to him. One day, he saw her speaking warmly with another man and
in that instant, jealousy struck him like a sword. The pain was sharp,
but the insight that followed was sharper still. The trap was clear—how
attachment binds the heart, how longing turns quickly to anguish.

He ended the relationship quietly, moved by a painful recognition that
such attachment would only lead to suffering. That moment was an early
glimpse of the turning away that would one day deepen into renunciation.

For Shanaka, this inner steadiness didn’t come easily. He would later
describe his school years as a “terrible time”—a period of raging
hormones and intense temptation.

Growing up in Lesotho among expatriate families, he was surrounded by
Western ideals. Some classmates were sexually unreserved; others
experimented with drugs. While drugs held little interest for him, the
allure of Friday night discos—the dancing, the laughter, the
intoxicating company of girls—was a constant pull.

Though he longed to join them, he was too shy to ask his father for
money. That hesitation—mingled with a sense of shame—kept him away from
habits that might have veered him off course.

Even then, traces of a deeper potential flickered beneath his outward
rough character. At sixteen, he had a quiet intuition that life was
about to change—that by eighteen, something decisive would turn. And it
did. But the first signs came not in temples or scriptures, but in the
ordinary tests of youth.

There was a British girl he had a crush on. The interest was mutual; she
even sent a friend to pass a message of affection. Yet when his own
friend urged him to respond, his reply was unusually philosophical for a
teenager: “I don’t want to play with the world until I know about it.”

That restraint was from an unspoken sense that the world operated
according to a certain order, and he didn’t want to mess with it until
he understood its rules. This moral instinct—a quiet wish to act rightly
without knowing why—was a kind of *sīla*, he believes, that created a
respect from even those girls.

That same instinct followed him into early adulthood. But conscience,
when untested, is only theory.

Having just turned eighteen, before his first real spiritual experiences
or any encounter with Ven. Ñāṇavimala, he found himself facing a test of
another kind. While playing club cricket, he associated with older
teammates who often went to the pub after matches for beers. One day,
they started chanting:

“Shanaka is going to drink today!”… “Shanaka is going to drink!”

The pressure was overwhelming. The glass was placed in front of him, and
for a moment, his mind wavered. Perhaps just a sip, a thought whispered.
It’s only once… why not?

And then—through the noise—came a clear voice. One of the players’ wives
turned toward him and said:

“Shanaka, stick to your principles.”

Her words cut through the confusion. In that instant, his thoughts
cleared, and conviction returned. His hand stilled beside the glass.

He said nothing, but the act itself stayed with him. It showed him how
easily one could slip, and how quietly one could stand firm.

Even then, Shanaka’s sense of *sīla* was more a matter of conscience
than insight—a kind of moral pride, a wish to show he had the willpower
to resist what others yielded to, mixed with a sense of shyness.  
  
However, something within him was quietly preparing for change, though
he could never have imagined it unfolding how it did.

What began shortly after as a spontaneous spiritual insight was soon
forged into true discipline under the steady influence of Ven.
Ñāṇavimala.

As the years passed, that quiet guidance grew firmer. Nearing
twenty-five, Ven. Ñāṇavimala perhaps sensed that Shanaka stood at a
threshold—the age when the world begins to pull one outward, offering
paths that promise comfort, but bind the heart more tightly. He would
gently remind him to be firm in his direction, knowing that the world
would soon expect other commitments.

Around this time, Shanaka took a job at an auditing firm, a decision
that met with his teacher’s quiet disapproval. He remarked to Shanaka,
almost in passing:

“I tell you to go this way,” he gestured one direction, “but then you go
that way,” turning his hand the other way.

It was said in such passing, the words seeming to drift away as he
turned to another topic. Yet, for Shanaka, they did not drift at all.
The words landed with an immense weight. For Shanaka this passing remark
carried the force of a reprimand. It was the only time Ven. Gnanaloka
recalls he felt him express visible disapproval at him.

During this time, some assumed Shanaka had let go of the idea of
ordaining. They speculated that he would settle down and start a family.
But Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s influence lingered in him like a quiet echo. Back
in the lay world, surrounded by temptation, Shanaka began to understand
the true scope of his teacher’s path. It was one thing to admire
simplicity from afar; another to live amidst desire and remain unmoved.

Following his teacher’s guidance he resolved to practice sense
restraint, particularly by averting his gaze from the powerful allure of
feminine beauty—not out of disrespect, but as an act of inner
discipline. He meditated during lunch breaks, even in the office
restroom, and kept his interactions with women brief and professional.
It was an immense effort to steady a mind conditioned by countless lives
of desire.

Yet this outward composure often hid a fiercer inner reality. The fire
of lust still burned greatly. This became painfully clear at twenty-six,
during a pilgrimage to the sacred Ruwanwelisaya *stūpa* in Sri Lanka.

Midway through the journey, his mind was suddenly overwhelmed by a storm
of lustful thoughts—as if a force from outside himself had descended
upon him. The assault was so intense that he was forced to turn back. He
never reached the holy site that day.

What he didn't yet know: the intensity itself was a sign. When
breakthrough nears, the storm becomes fiercest.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s uncompromising counsel echoed in him:

“You must see a tremendous need to turn away from the *kāma-loka* — the
world of sensual pleasure.”

Yet the mind does not submit to willpower alone. It must be met
wisely—its habits understood, not fought against.

For this, Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s advice was: “When unwholesome thoughts
arise, counter them with *asubha saññā*”:

This practice is about seeing the truth of the body beyond the
superficial appearance that the world values so highly. It means
investigating its inherent foul nature by seeing it as the Buddha
taught—a fragile assembly of internal organs, tissues, and fluids,
thinly veiled by a layer of skin; an assembly subject to decay and
unworthy of attachment. This reflection reveals how the mind falsely
takes the body as its own—an attachment born of deception, which
perpetuates seeking delight in food and the human form. Seeing this, the
grip of identification with the body weakens, the fever of lust cools,
and a wise, liberating dispassion arises—finding its worth in wisdom,
not in fleeting appearances.

Then Ven. Ñāṇavimala added:

“If that fails, read the Dhammapada[69]. Trace the root. See where the
attachment lies. Know that it stems from ignorance—from clinging to what
is not truly yours.”

He urged the careful watching of the mind—to learn to recognize the root
before it overpowers. Ven. Ñāṇavimala would say:

“Whenever you delight in pleasant feeling, know that delusion is close
by.”

Ven. Ñāṇavimala would tell Shanaka again and again—throughout the day to
bring one’s mindfulness to reflect on one’s conduct. He directed him to
the *Ambalaṭṭhika Rāhulovāda Sutta* (MN61; Advice to Rāhula at
Ambalaṭṭhika)—the Buddha’s counsel to his own son. This practice is to
hold a mirror to body, speech, and mind—look before you act, watch while
acting, and review afterward. If unwholesome actions have occurred,
honestly recognize it and resolve to let it go.

Ven. Gnanaloka remembered meeting a rishi in India who carried the
essence of this very principle: each day, he would write down every
unwholesome thought that had arisen in him on the wall of his cave.

Over time, the writings grew fewer.

Then eventually, they became zero.

“Purified mind brings purified action,” Ven. Ñāṇavimala used to say. The
mind’s activities, when recognised honestly without judgement, begin
purifying themselves.

For his first solitary retreat, Shanaka chose the secluded Kalugala
Forest Monastery, a sanctuary nestled in the hills of Sri Lanka’s
Kalutara District near the dense Sinh<span class="mark">arāja</span>
rainforest. It was the ideal setting to put his teacher’s guidance into
practice. Before departing, Ven. Ñāṇavimala gave him one essential
instruction for his protection:

“Be well-grounded in the Four Protective Meditations before heading to
the jungle.”

They were:

- *Buddhānussati* \[Recollection on Buddha’s
  qualities\]<span class="mark">—</span>to uplift and steady the mind,

- *Mettā* \[Loving-kindness\]<span class="mark">—</span>to guard against
  ill will,

- *Asubhasaññā* \[Perception of foulness\]<span class="mark">—</span>to
  weaken sensual craving,

- *Maraṇānussati* \[Recollection of death\]<span class="mark">—</span>to
  cultivate urgency and clarity.

These were not rituals to be recited. They were armor. A toolkit for the
mind in solitude. And he was right. Almost immediately upon entering the
forest, lustful thoughts rose unexpectedly.

Shanaka came to see sense restraint not as submission, but as a quiet
freedom—a peace of mind untouched by the pull of the senses.

Yet even as this understanding deepened, Shanaka found himself torn
between lay life and the monastic path. He looked to his teacher for an
answer. Once, he shared a simile that perfectly encapsulated his
approach:

“Like a sailor when crossing a river, slowly, not losing the other
shore, direct the boat slowly, gradually cutting the stream. Similarly,
you should direct your life.”

For Shanaka, with practice and his teacher’s guidance he gradually
became confident in how to skillfully navigate his life, adjusting
according to the conditions and choosing the right tools at the right
moment to meet and overcome the current of sense desires.

His teacher taught this art not with many words, but with his very life.
In that silent, steadfast example, the answer shone brighter than any
spoken word. And in its light, his student found the courage to follow.

*<span class="mark">Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera giving a brief Dhamma
discourse to lay devotees who had come to offer dāna at Polgasduwa
Island Hermitage. Even in brief encounters, Ven. Ñāṇavimala seemed to
see deeply into a person’s nature, offering words that met them with
quiet precision and compassion (1994).</span>*

**Reflection 05: The Protection of Mettā**

For Ven. Ñāṇavimala, compassion was not a simple sentiment, but wisdom
itself—a seeing that cut through illusion and a courage that met death
with a pure heart. A quality forged, it seemed, across many lifetimes.
As a young man in Germany, working in the farm, he battled with an
internal struggle—that ploughing the land he was killing tiny creatures.
Later on he would understand this sensitivity, one born from a deep
karmic learning.

He sometimes spoke of past-life recollections that began to occur after
his practice of mindfulness (*Satipaṭṭhāna*) had deepened. These were
not meditative experiences in the usual sense, but spontaneous
memories—appearing like dreams, though he remained conscious of
them.[83]

One such recollection concerned a past life in which he was a soldier.
In the heat of battle, he found he could not bring himself to kill. In
that moment of hesitation, an enemy horseman’s lance killed him. He
remembered the scene with startling clarity.

He later got to know in this life that a monument commemorating that war
event stood in that very place in Germany. From his recollection he came
to understand that it was because of his family at the time that he was
put into that situation, and the event was a source of his deep
rejection for harming in his most recent life.

As a layman he was interested in Hinduism, yoga and was a strict
vegetarian. He viewed Mahatma Gandhi as a role model. Later, during his
internment camp, he refused to eat meat and nearly died until his
Buddhist friends encouraged him to accept the meat for sustenance. He
recovered—and from that experience came a new appreciation of the
Buddha’s Middle Path.

As a monk, his perspective deepened further. “Everything that takes
place in this world entails killing,” he would say. He taught that all
existence in *saṁsāra*, even the very act of survival, inadvertently
involves harm—the growing of rice kills insects, and everyday acts such
as walking kills unseen beings. The highest compassion, he explained,
was not about perfecting one’s diet, but about ending rebirth
itself—extinguishing the very ‘self’ that must be sustained at the
expense of other life. He taught that one’s intention was paramount;
taking delight in tastes was a greater harm than the act of eating meat
itself. If one had an attachment to the taste of meat, he would advise,
one should make a purposeful effort to give it up for that reason.

He carried this compassion into his alms round, mindful not of what was
offered, but placing the needs of the giver foremost. When a wealthy lay
devotee once wanted to continue offering specially prepared delicacies
after the initial offering, he responded “Please give an opportunity for
poor people also to offer alms.”[84] He was especially attentive that
the poor had the chance to give, understanding—through his deep sense of
*kamma*—that their present hardship was but the unfolding of past
causes, and that through the merit of generosity now, they could help
shape brighter conditions to come.

His compassion remained consistent, even when concern for his health
became a test of it.

Later on, whilst at Polgasduwa Hermitage, Shanaka and other devotees,
concerned for his ill health, once made a special arrangement for
particular nutritious food packets to be offered to him. He refused,
stating simply, “This is not ascetic” and insisted on taking what was
normally being given to everyone.

This deep, inner quality of goodwill, was not just a philosophy; it was
a tangible force. It manifested as a protective energy, a quiet
fearlessness that could be felt by all beings, human and animal alike.
This was the quality that Ven. Gnanaloka would later come to rely on in
the remote jungles, where he directly experienced its power.

In 2007, Ven. Gnanaloka spent six months in complete silence at
Bambaragasthalawa—a remote cave within Kumana National Park (Yala East).
What struck him most about the place was not just its seclusion but its
absolute stillness. Even the animals seemed to respect the silence. The
ancient cave, once used by meditating monks during the height of
Buddhism in Sri Lanka, had likely not been inhabited by humans for
centuries. Now, it belonged to the bears and leopards who ruled the
jungle.

The nearest village was 15 to 20 kilometres away. A few concerned
devotees had arranged for a *kapakaru* (lay attendant) to offer the
daily meal. But Ven. Gnanaloka made it a point never to see or speak
with him. If there was an urgent message, it would be left in writing
near the alms bowl. Otherwise, noble silence prevailed.

One night, while lying on his side in the cave, he heard a low, rhythmic
sound. At first, it felt like a dream. Then it grew clearer—deep, heavy
breathing. Without rising, he reached toward the lamp and adjusted the
wick. As the light spread across the cave, a wild bear came into
view—just a few feet in front of him.

Instinctively, he began chanting:

“*Virūpakkehi me mettaṁ — Mettaṁ Erāpathehi*...”

(from the *Khandha Paritta*, AN 4.67–68)[85]

The bear turned and fled—vanishing into the forest like a dissolving
shadow.

Years earlier, Ven. Ñāṇavimala had shared similar encounters. While
meditating in a cave at Kudumbigala, a bear once entered and stood on
its hind legs, claws raised. Ven. Ñāṇavimala calmly recited the *Khandha
Paritta*. As he continued, the bear lowered its paws and walked away. On
another occasion, while walking through a national park, he came face to
face with a bear. He lowered his gaze, radiated *mettā*, and when he
looked up again, the bear was gone. When someone asked, “Bhante, what if
the bear had attacked you?” he replied:

“Well, then I would have died with a pure heart.”

As a young man, Shanaka once recalled Ven. Ñāṇavimala telling him:

“Recite the *Khandha Paritta* daily and act with *mettā* to all beings.”

Those simple instructions may have saved his life more than once.

Ven. Gnanaloka remembered another incident at Kudumbigala Forest
Monastery[86], deep in the jungle, seated in meditation, surrounded by
trees, insects, and venomous snakes, he remained in stillness for hours.
Then, a sensation—something heavy on his lap. He ignored it. Only later,
when lifting his robes, did he discover a snake coiled across his legs,
perhaps seeking warmth. As he gently moved, the snake raised its head
and met his gaze. There was no fear—only a quiet recognition, almost
like meeting an old friend. The snake turned, looked back a few times,
and slowly disappeared into the forest.

He realised then: this was the power of *mettā*.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala used to say:

“Develop this heart of *mettā* in the highest way to all beings. This
will be the greatest service to all beings from you.”

And from all that could be seen, he lived by this principle in every
moment.

He often spoke of *mettā-ceto-vimutti*—the liberation of the heart
through loving-kindness—not as a technique, but as a way of being.

To speak of compassion is one thing. To embody it when death stands
close is another. But this was the way Ven. Ñāṇavimala walked—not once,
but again and again—with unwavering courage, turning principle into

- All these blessings and merit that you have accrued—may you achieve
  your goal.

<!-- -->

- **You may practice as mentioned in *Sutta* 107, 117, 125 of
  *Majjhima*** \[*Gaṇakamoggallāna Sutta* (MN 107; to Gaṇaka
  Moggallāna); *Mahācattārīsaka Sutta* (MN117; the great forty);
  *Dantabhūmi Sutta* (MN125; the grade of the tamed)\] and
  *Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda Sutta* (MN61; advice to Rāhula at
  Ambalaṭṭhika), **if you are keen to enter the path, then
  *Kha<span class="mark">ndha</span> Vagga*** (SN22; Connected
  Discourses on the Aggregates) and *Saḷāyatana Vagga* (SN35; The
  Connected Discourses on the Six Sense Bases). **This effort you make
  in this direction will be the highest form of merit. And will be the
  only way to repay parents, relatives and ultimately to all beings. It
  will be a blessing.**

<!-- -->

- As a layman, *Suttas* mentioned to Mahānāma[87].

- Know when you \[return\], you would have to accommodate a bit. You may
  not find people with an understanding for this. In that case, you
  would not try to convince them or convert them, but with the heart of
  *mettā*, you should also keep away from them and should not follow
  their inclinations.

- You will truly be able to help your relatives and everyone else only
  if you purify yourself. Because from a purified mind, purified actions
  follow.

- <span class="mark">\[Quote from Ven. Ñāṇavimala\] “Regarding
  *Saddhātissa*, it may be true that we would have been together. But
  one must stick to the present. As the present makes the future. One
  must control the mind. They are just thoughts (past and
  future).</span> This name seems to be very familiar, we would have
  been together in past lives. **But you must stick to the All
  Enlightened One’s words and advice. As in *Mahāparinibbāna Sutta*
  (DN16; the Great Passing), where the Buddha said, *‘After my passing
  away, that your teacher will be the Dhamma and the Vinaya’.”*** [88]

<!-- -->

- \[*Quote from Ven. Ñāṇavimala*\] “I also got something after 20 years
  in the Saṅgha. There is *kamma* behind \[this\]”. \[*Personal Note:*\]
  (Maybe an attainment etc.)[89]

- *Ariya sīla* is observed when one is practicing *Satipaṭṭhāna*.

- You can’t fall into negligence because you have a lot to work on. That
  is to overcome the hindrances (five of them) and to attain *jhāna*.
  And that state of peace and so as to see its true nature of *anicca*,
  *dukkha* and *anatta*, because it is also a state of consciousness.

- *Mātugāma Sutta* (SN37.1; women)[90]

- Sutta 39 and 40 in *Majjhima* leading to *jhāna*—*Mahāassapura Sutta*
  (MN39; the greater discourse at assapura); *Cūḷaassapura Sutta* (MN40;
  the shorter discourse at assapura).

- A Gradual Training in 107 and 125 in *Majjhima*—*Gaṇakamoggallāna
  Sutta* (MN107; to gaṇaka moggallāna); *Dantabhūmi Sutta* (MN125; the
  grade of the tamed).

- You must not try to preach and so you must center on yourself. Based
  on your pure state of mind, purified action will flow. To benefit both
  you and all beings.

- You cannot be negligent as it is so uncertain. The *sāsana* nearly
  disappeared twice in Sri Lanka. It can disappear again. So we do not
  know what will happen tomorrow. So make haste right now.

- To get *saṁvega* (think of the endless past what we had to go
  through), e.g. the tears more than the four oceans etc. and what is
  ahead of us in Dīgha 26—*Cakkavattisīhanāda Sutta* (DN26; the lion’s
  roar on the wheel-turning monarch).

- Dīgha 27—*Aggañña Sutta* (DN27; on knowledge of beginnings)

**5 December 1995**

- *Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda Sutta* (MN61; advice to Rāhula at
  Ambalaṭṭhika): You do things and follow actions that benefit both
  parties or that which reduces *lobha* (greed)*, dosa* (hate) *and
  moha* (delusion).

- The way you reflected in the past \[how\] the present things are
  formed; for example, you have acted with ‘I’ conceit etc. Therefore,
  now \[there occurs\] the present manifestation of the body and so on.
  As time goes on you will understand it deeply. Nothing from outside
  could help you to see things in reality. But the mind \[itself\]
  should be slowly established and trained to reflect \[on things\] as
  not mine and so on.

- You must make plans for the near future (e.g. going to the station in
  the morning) and quickly come back to the present and must practice
  *sati sampajañña*. This should be the way throughout.

<!-- -->

- **Past inclination would manifest, but one must delight in overcoming
  those inclinations and coming to mastery of them, in the present life.
  It is a great difficulty to overcome attractions to people \[with
  whom\] one was connected to in past lives**[91]**.**

<!-- -->

- Whatever momentary happiness there is, it is \[merely\] a temporary
  intoxication. But far more suffering is connected with it. Therefore,
  overcome it by developing the opposite faculties \[5 *indriyas*—5
  spiritual faculties\] and \[take\] delight \[in them\]. For example,
  Ven. Nanda when he was an Arahant, a *devī* \[female celestial being\]
  from the *deva loka* \[celestial realm\] who had once been his consort
  appeared. However, he replied that, as an Arahant, he had no such
  connections[92].

<!-- -->

- *Majjhima Sutta* 131 (*Bhaddekaratta Sutta**,*** MN131) practice like
  that. Stick to the present.

- When you go to certain temples or meditation centers (Remember
  *Mātugāma*)—*Mātugāma Saṁyutta* (SN 37; linked discourses on females).

<!-- -->

- **Try to avoid such contact \[with the opposite sex\] as far as
  possible.**

<!-- -->

- **Don’t look at them.**

- **If you have to look at them, don’t talk.**

- **If you have to talk, then think of the *asubha*.**

<!-- -->

- When you have attained the first *jhāna*, you should go to the second
  and so on until one reaches *Nibbāna*. Never should one stick to even
  good states, however, as a Bodhisattva, the Buddha was never satisfied
  with good states).

- Certain verses or *Suttas* that had an impact, isolate them and repeat
  it over and over again.

<!-- -->

- Further qualities to be developed when one is established in 5
  \[spiritual\] faculties (*indriya*), *saddhā, viriya, sati, samādhi,
  paññā* \[*Paṭhamavibhaṅga Sutta* (SN48.36; Analysis (1)\].

There are six qualities to be grown - *Mahānāma Sutta* (AN6.10; to
Mahānāma)

1.  Recollect the Tathāgata—Happiness should develop in connection to
    repeated recollection.

2.  Recollect the Dhamma

3.  Recollect the Saṅgha

4.  You should recollect your own virtues

5.  You should recollect your own generosity (*cāga*)

6.  You should recollect the *devas*

**6 December 1995**

- Daily practice of a bhikkhu is to overcome the five hindrances and to
  develop the five *indriya*.[93]

- And we come back to *Ambalaṭṭhika Rāhulovāda Sutta* (MN61; advice to
  Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika) *(Tīṇi Sucaritāni—three ways of good conduct)*
  *ariyakanta sīla*[94], this is accomplished when you practice
  *Satipaṭṭhāna*—*Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta* (DN22; the foundations of
  mindfulness).

- You should act in the way of *Mahāsuññata Sutta* (MN122; the greater
  discourse on voidness). That is verbal and mental actions.

<!-- -->

- *Majjhima* 131—*Bhaddekaratta Sutta* (MN131; a single excellent night)
  is very important, because it is not worth following the past (past
  lives etc.) and having future hopes and definite plans etc.

- Visions and dreams and so on, one makes a note of it but does not
  follow them. Some may be right, some maybe not. But should always and
  totally rely on the words of the Buddha.

- And regarding attainment; how can anyone know unless declared by the
  Buddha or an Arahant with *abhiññā*? It was forbidden for bhikkhus to
  declare their attainment, how much so laymen. And what’s the point of
  speculating? What one should ensure is that one is acting in the
  present in accordance with a way that brings one closer to a state of
  peace and certainty regarding the Dhamma.

- <span class="mark">\[Quote from Ven. Ñāṇavimala\] “For example, there
  was a yogi who \[believed\] they were an *Anāgāmi*, and I said that
  they would go mad if they continued to think in that way. A year or so
  later, it happened that they \[did indeed\] go mad.”</span>[95]

<!-- -->

- In *Majjhima* 105—*Sunakkhatta Sutta* (MN105; to Sunakkhatta), how
  many came and declared in front of the Buddha their final attainment.
  Among them some were true and some were not.

- It is peaceful when one practices the Dhamma \[in the present
  moment\].

- Now when you \[return\] to the layman’s life, it is as if you are
  going on *piṇḍapāta*: you are going to give and this is the highest
  giving. First you may establish them in *dāna*, *sīla,*
  *bhāvanā*—*Sigālovāda Sutta* (DN31; advice to Sigāla). Furthermore you
  can \[guide them\] to establish them in Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha. For
  those who are further interested in attaining the path: \[the\]
  *Suttas* taught to *Mahānāma* and
  *<span class="mark">Anāthapiṇḍika</span>* and *Rāhulovāda* *Sutta*,
  *Mettā* *bhāvanā* (as mentioned by Ven. Ñāṇamoli).

<!-- -->

- If you are unable to practise the three ways of conduct perfectly, do
  not have remorse; what is past is past. However, must make a
  determination to avoid it in the future.

- You must encourage others in *paviveka* (solitude)—for laypeople, at
  least on the *poya* days. As for yourself, try to retire \[into
  solitude\] as soon as possible, 2 or 3 days before and after the
  *poya*.

- The way you act and direct the mind in that environment is very
  creative and constructive. One must constantly concentrate on one’s
  practice and only by one’s example that one encourages others.

- Attaining the *Jhānas* step by step training the *Suttas* 107 and 125
  of *Majjhima*—*Gaṇakamoggallāna Sutta* (MN107; to gaṇaka moggallāna);
  *Dantabhūmi Sutta* (MN125; the grade of the tamed) and then to attain
  to the path, *Khandha* and *Saḷāyatana Saṁyuttas*.

- In any case, daily one must make it a point even if it is in the night
  for this *bhāvanā*[96].

<!-- -->

- **One must not overload with intellectual grasping of the *Suttas*.
  One picks out one or two and bring the mind to that actual nature of
  function mentioned in the *Suttas*.**[97] **This is very important!**

<!-- -->

- To get *saṁvega* (spiritual urgency)*:* Dīgha 26—Cakkavattisīhanāda
  Sutta (DN26; the lion’s roar on the wheel-turning monarch);
  *Anamataggasaṃyutta* (SN15; connected discourses on without
  discoverable beginning).

- And never be satisfied with good states.

<!-- -->

- You must establish others in only what you yourself are established in
  and what you clearly see and have experienced.

- When some people (laymen) recite the *gāthās* etc. in their shrine
  room, certain *devatās* (blood relatives) come and impart certain
  information. They have a wider field of knowledge. E.g. when Reverend
  Sir went on *cārikā* in Minneriya even how he was offered a lunch
  pack.[98]

- All the merit that you have accrued and the past background in the
  Dhamma etc. will come to fruit, even though you have to deviate a bit
  from suitable conditions for the practice presently.

- Do you remember *Makhādeva Sutta* (MN83; King Makhādeva) in
  *Majjhima*, the noble practice started by Makhādeva which led to the
  Brahma world \[being\] stopped at the point of king Nimi.

- The Buddha warns how not to be the last in the *Ariyan* lineage
  \[noble lineage\].[99]

> **7 December 1995**

- When you use all that is available then it spoils the Saṅgha.

<!-- -->

- That is what has happened in the temple(s).

- **What you should do is restrain or abstain and endure.**

- This is the Way.

- The bhikkhu’s attitude is to leave things.

- When he endures, he does not feed on craving.

<!-- -->

- To like solitude, it is necessary to have *kamma* in the past. Or it
  should be cultivated. Because it is necessary to strive in solitude to
  experience certain things that cannot be reasoned out, like *jhānas*
  and *vipassanā* knowledge.

- *Sutta* 9 in *Majjhima*—*Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta* (MN9; right view)

<!-- -->

- Like Raṭṭhapāla and others, like the one who was married, the wife
  kept the child in front of him, because he was an arahant, there is no
  effect.[100] It is *acintiya* \[inconceivable\]
  <span class="mark"></span>at thought level, to think how arahants are
  thinking. (They are looking at the whole process from outside). As
  they are considering as not mine and not I. That’s why most of the
  arahants are silent.

<!-- -->

- You must consider yours’ and others’ welfare. You have already done it
  with your relatives . It’s the beginning.

- But never forget your welfare which is most important. And it is the
  first priority! “*Attadatthaṁ paratthena”* (*Attadatthatthera Vatthu*,
  Dhp 166).

**8 December 1995**

- **If you follow another religion, that means you never got a true
  understanding in the Dhamma.**

***Important:***

- **Some may decide to be *Anagārika* and so on.**[101] **But one must
  consider this may create *asmi-māna* \[egocentric conceit\], that I am
  better than others or different to others etc. It is important out of
  respect and gratitude to the Buddha that one accommodates, and has the
  Buddha as one’s constant aim. For three years I was an *upāsaka* and I
  was quite alright like that, but I reflected how I got all that
  opportunity, it is because of the Saṅgha. It is always good not to
  separate oneself from the outside framework. Always respecting the
  Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha.**

<!-- -->

- By entering the Saṅgha, one encourages the Saṅgha and brings unity.

<!-- -->

- **Less you need to support yourself as a bhikkhu or as a layman, the
  better it is.**

<!-- -->

- Always must not worry what changes from outside. But must know even if
  things that seem to be pleasant are connected with feelings. Anyone
  who delights in feelings, delights in suffering. So, one must be happy
  that one is constantly following the way that learns to delight in the
  Dhamma, that is ultimately developed beyond feelings.

- Always developing equanimity, see even that the highest state of mind
  is connected with consciousness. For consciousness needs an object and
  depends on the body, so it is *anicca, dukkha* and *anatta*.

<!-- -->

- To do all these it takes some time. So, you have to see it as a layman
  or *bhikkhu* that one first reduces
  *<span class="mark">saṅkhār</span>as* that is coming up till *jhāna*.
  So, it is a gradual process of reducing
  *<span class="mark">saṅkhār</span>as* and overcoming them.

- Whenever you notice that you are delighting in some kind of pleasant
  feeling, know that there is delusion at that time. From time to time
  the attraction to the opposite sex will come. You should know that for
  many lives we have given into this strongest fetter. It is not easy to
  overcome overnight, only by this *asubha* that one sees the delusion
  behind it. And one overcomes it immediately. And again *Rāhulovāda
  Sutta*, for my welfare and for others, and should firmly stick to the
  learning to reflect before, while and after all actions.

<!-- -->

- When meeting people from other religions, you should instruct them
  (mentioned by Venerable Piyadassi) and encourage them to follow their
  religion.[102] All religions talk about *dāna, sīla* and *bhāvanā*.
  But in this Dhamma there is this *Satipaṭṭhāna*.

- All religions and their founders are ones who reached a certain high
  state. But it lasts only for some time and collapses again. Whether it
  is Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism.

- The western countries are materially driven, each one wanting to
  advance more than the other. Then war begins. And then when everything
  collapses, they go to the churches etc. But when things become
  alright, again they get back to building. This is because their
  spiritual experience is based on *micchā diṭṭhi* (wrong view).

<!-- -->

- When you think how the *arahant* thinks, it is not possible to
  understand, but if we just consider he experiences things from a
  distance.

<!-- -->

- There is happiness in worldly life and the suffering of the renounced
  life. But the suffering of the renounced life is better than the
  happiness of the worldly life. When I went on *cārikā*, I was
  completely independent; but do not think it was easy. There was
  suffering and it is like that until death. No formation is complete or
  satisfactory. And all that we experience, that which we have done or
  created, so making sure the mind is always directed to a state (where
  one will be free from all this suffering forever) without creating
  disharmony or conflict with the surrounding that one is in.

- You must not try to be a scholar, and going on preaching etc. like in
  the temples, are one activity after the other—more *saṅkhāras*.
  Satisfying the *dāyakas* \[lay devotees\] etc. and losing sight of the
  essential practice, which in return makes the Saṅgha deteriorate.

- The *Suttas* *Majjhima* 131, 19 ,20, 107, 117, 125—*Bhaddekaratta
  Sutta* (MN131; a single excellent night); *Dvedhāvitakka Sutta* (MN19;
  two kinds of thought); *Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta* (MN20; removal of
  distracting thoughts); *Gaṇakamoggallāna Sutta* (MN107; to Gaṇaka
  Moggallāna); *Mahācattārīsaka Sutta* (MN117; the great forty);
  *Dantabhūmi Sutta* (MN125; the grade of the tamed)

- When you get back \[home\], *Mahānāma Suttas*.[103]

- This way of activity (mentioned in Mahānāma *Suttas*) gives a chance
  to glimpse the ultimate at that level, as a layman.

- 

**9 December 1995**

- **When you direct your mind to a certain sphere, then as if by force,
  you get support and response in that direction. For example: when
  someone is trying to climb a mountain, he begins to meet people who
  are on the same path and they help each other to come to the goal.**

<!-- -->

- One must learn in all one’s activities to stick to the present.
  *Majjhima* 131 (*Bhaddekaratta Sutta*, MN131)

- One must not try to think whether one has attained the path or one
  will attain the path. But must stick to the practice as advised by the
  Buddha, not sticking to a person, etc.

- Practice according to the *Suttas* 107,117,125 (*Gaṇakamoggallāna
  Sutta*, MN107; *Mahācattārīsaka Sutta*, MN117; *Dantabhūmi Sutta*,
  MN125) leading to the *jhāna*. And if one wants to enter the path
  *Khandha* and *Saḷāyatana Saṁyutta<span class="mark">s</span>*. This
  is almost the noble eightfold path.

- Seeing always the causes of this suffering and removing it. It is
  removing the *nīvaraṇas.*

- There is always the danger that one may become a scholar. In the
  beginning, the first arahants heard only one *Sutta*. You may make
  note of certain *Suttas* that had an impact. And may repeat them. Only
  as the practice progresses that you may refer to more *Suttas*.

- You must try your best to help others by your example. When you turn
  away. And when they see that, it is an encouragement for them to do
  the same.

- When you don’t think of a person or an individual, but as a whole, for
  example as the Mahā Saṅgha, that is spiritual. One must regularly
  develop the delight connected to Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha.

- *Purāṇa kamma* is the present body and what is experienced with it.
  And making sure in the present one reflects wisely the presently
  arisen phenomenon, so that future arising would not take place.

- **May you be successful in all your endeavors (last words).**

**11 December 1995**

- From *sati* it is possible to attain *jhāna*.

- As you go on, one day you should determine to learn the Dhamma in the
  exact words of the Buddha, that is in <span class="mark">Pāli</span>.
  There is no other language to \[better\] describe the ideas expressed
  by the Buddha, except Pali. The other thing is when the translator
  translates with his defiled mind the meaning undoubtedly changes.

- You may read the *Thera Gāthās* (Th; verses of the elder monks) to get
  inspiration. Like this you can add some knowledge that fits to the
  main practice.

- What is most important now is to establish these practices so that
  they become a habit. In all conditions.

- As soon as you concentrate and see every experience from the point of
  view of the Buddha’s teaching, all difficulties and suffering vanish.

- Then one looks at it from a distance, as if not mine etc. It goes up
  to the end (arahantship), the practice until one is continuously
  experiencing from that point of view. You see they are just processes
  and phenomena. When you stick to this awareness certainty should come
  and doubt should vanish.

- May you be a help for many beings. It starts at home. All who have a
  body will go through, some time or the other, the suffering connected
  to it. May they all come to the utter release from this suffering. May
  you go ahead of all of them, that will be a great help.

<!-- -->

- **Most of life is created by sex. Most of the time we meet people who
  were connected to us from the past. One is totally blinded \[by\]
  illusion when one is sexually attracted. And \[once\] involved,
  \[mental\] bondages are made only after all that is done. One
  \[should\] see the suffering connected \[with it\] and involved in it.
  So one must take care.**

<!-- -->

- In the Dhamma when help is possible to be given, you may do so but not
  at personal expense, otherwise one may get on, making all these things
  fall off[104], because what we see, hear, etc. there is *kamma* behind
  it, but they are just feelings, perception “not mine” “not I”.

- You may discuss with your parents, relatives, telling them clearly and
  definitely your intentions.

- Later on, when you are definitely certain you may act like
  Raṭṭhapāla—*Raṭṭhapāla Sutta* (MN 82; on Raṭṭhapāla). But you should
  act in such a way that will create harmony, and not disharmony.[105]
  And especially your relatives have been useful and helpful from a
  young age. And they are connected to you from past lives. So, you have
  to help each other.

**12 December 1995**

- Make sure you develop the mind now, not to worry about what is ahead
  and what has happened. But learning to observe the present with skill.
  Try to get established in this until you are here. Then you will be
  able to face anything with an undisturbed mind. And when you try to
  avoid foreseen activities and bondages, restraining your inner
  inclination, remember this is *kamma*. And when you are fully
  directing the mind, things would change from outside.

<!-- -->

- **Very Important: You must learn to get along alone. Because what is
  ultimately to be cultivated, goes beyond outside access and
  intervention, and in any case the outside situations change too. I too
  had support for five years and was left alone. Then I have to go
  through the *Suttas* by myself. There is *kamma* behind all these
  things. You may meet certain people who would give support at
  different levels. You must be like a clever sailor or a mountaineer,
  not going straight through but criss-cross, never losing the aim.**

<!-- -->

- For your uncle: *Sigālovāda Sutta* (DN31; advice to Sigāla), *Mettā*
  *Bhāvanā*, *Buddhism in a Nutshell* by Nārada Thera.

<!-- -->

- You may discuss it with your parents and relatives. Prestige is not
  important. In any case all this material gain ultimately brings
  disaster. And you may tell your future aim. And you may openly tell
  the difficulties faced when attending the classes etc.

<!-- -->

- Even to enter the Saṅgha, there is *kamma* behind it. So one must try
  to support the bhikkhus to get on undisturbed.

<!-- -->

- It is impossible that you spend the whole time in *pīti* and
  happiness.

<!-- -->

- **Regarding women, act in the way Venerable Ānanda was advised to
  do**—***Mahāparinibbāna Sutta* (DN16; the Great Passing).**[106]

- **When you go to the classes and when you practice restraint etc. you
  are practicing the Dhamma.**

**13 December 1995**

- We may meet again or not or these conditions may come or will not
  come. But what is important is that you direct to the Dhamma in
  whatever condition one is in. That this state of mind is undisturbed.
  One lives in the present, that itself is a happiness. And making the
  conditions more suitable to do that undisturbed and continuously in a
  harmonized way. Because when the objects change very fast it is
  difficult to practice this.

<!-- -->

- The Hindus and so on, when their teacher dies, the pupils \[seek\] out
  where he is \[re-\]born and bring him back to teach. The yogis, no
  doubt, work very hard. They consider that which they \[strive\] for as
  permanent, but it is \[still\] within consciousness and therefore a
  formation. All formations are *anicca* (impermanent), *dukkha*
  (suffering) and *anatta* (non-self). They have *asmi-māna*
  (ego-conceit), but the bhikkhus do not.

- Many arahants at the time of the Buddha were previously in the
  Brahmaloka[107] or one who has cultivated *jhāna*. When they met the
  Buddha they easily attained *jhāna* and arahantship. In any case they
  experienced what they have done (the *kamma*) to come back to the
  human world (*manussaloka*).

- You may not be able to sit in *bhāvanā*[108] all the time. But you may
  go a step below, and contribute towards the concentration by reading
  the *Suttas*, reciting striking stanzas and memorizing etc.

- The Buddha as Bodhisatta (Makhādeva) arose many times in the
  Brahmaloka, but came back, still a *puthujjana* (common worldling).
  Until he understood the *paṭiccasamuppāda* (dependent origination).
  Then he became the *Dhamma Rāja* (king of Dhamma).

**14th - 16th February 1996**

\[Editor’s Note: The following *Sutta* list is from a final set of notes
that Ven. Ñāṇavimala himself classified, considering it “very

# *Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera seated near the monks’ dining hall at Polgasduwa Island Hermitage. He generally discouraged taking photographs, reminding those who asked: “Why do you want to see this foul body? See the Dhamma.” (circa mid–late 1990s).*

# **Reflection 06: Soft like Butter, Hard like Diamond**

Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera embodied a profound paradox—infinitely
gentle in spirit, yet unbreakable in will. To some, he appeared as a
saintly monk, radiating serene benevolence; to others, he was a fierce
ascetic whose unyielding determination allowed no compromise on the path
to liberation. As Ven. Gnanaloka would later reflect, his teacher was
utterly “intense in the Dhamma,” yet that intensity was always held
within a soft, warm smile—a contrast captured perfectly by the way he
would describe him: “soft like butter, hard like diamond.”

He did not shape his teachings to please, but to awaken. Sometimes his
words were tender, at other times sharp; sometimes his silence carried
more weight than speech. Yet always they were directed precisely to the
person before him. Whoever came to him was urged to walk with urgency,
as though time were slipping away. For many, this intensity was too much
to bear. Drawn by the aura of a saint, they often found themselves
unsettled by the fierceness of his path. With Ven. Ñāṇavimala, there was
no idle talk, no wasted time. It was practice, practice, and more
practice.

A senior monk who had completed over ten rains retreats once came to pay
respects. Shockingly, Ven. Ñāṇavimala treated him almost as a novice,
advising that he should remain under the guidance of a teacher until
maturity was reached—Ven. Gnanaloka felt awkward, even wondering if Ven.
Ñāṇavimala had misjudged him.

Yet as they left the kuti, the monk turned to Ven. Gnanaloka and said
quietly, “He knows everything about me.”

What seemed harsh was, in truth, a precise instruction, spoken exactly
as it was needed.

At other times, the lesson came without words. On one occasion, a doctor
was brought by lay supporters who thought he might be of help. As if
thinking Ven. Ñāṇavimala was just a frail old man with little awareness,
the doctor addressed his words to Ven.
Mettavih<span class="mark">ārī</span>, one of the attendants, rather
than Ven. Ñāṇavimala himself.

At one point he made a direct remark to him: “Everyone thinks you’re an
arahant, but I don’t consider like that”

Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s response was not in words. He remained in silence, his
neutral gaze resting with a quiet softness, a trace of a smile upon his
face.

Nothing in him shifted—no trace of irritation, no hint of pride.

For Shanaka, however, it was very different. Hearing his teacher spoken
of so carelessly stirred a surge of anger.

“I wanted to throw him out of the kuti,” he later admitted.

To be near Ven. Ñāṇavimala was often to feel as though one had stepped
into a kind of force field—an atmosphere of stillness where the mind
naturally became settled. But in that instant, it was as if he had been
pushed outside it.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala seemed to grow distant, and even the Buddha image nearby
to the side appeared to recede.

The moment came like a vision, exposing with clarity what had truly
arisen in his own heart: a thought of anger and ill will. Where his own
mind was inflamed, Ven. Ñāṇavimala sat utterly unmoved by either praise
or disrespect. The contrast was unmistakable.

Even in matters of requisites, Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s attitude remained the
same—gentle yet unbending. During his student years in Cyprus, Shanaka
had worked for the first time in his life, laboring for seven days.
After returning back to Sri Lanka, he went to a shop with his earnings
and carefully selected the best robe, alms bowl, and other requisites he
could find, preparing a complete *Atapirikara*—the traditional offering
of a monk’s eight basic requisites. He brought it to his teacher with
deep devotion, expecting Ven. Ñāṇavimala to accept it.

Smiling at the memory, Ven. Gnanaloka later recalled, “I can still
picture myself standing before him in his room. When I offered the
*Atapirikara*, he didn’t accept it!” To Shanaka’s determined insistence,
his teacher’s response was gently “Offer it to the Saṅgha”.

It was an answer Shanaka would hear many times. Though he was among Ven.
Ñāṇavimala’s closest attendants, there was never special treatment. This
was a level of asceticism that, even after decades of his own practice,
Ven. Gnanaloka felt he could never match. “Even for a glass of water, he
didn’t ask,” he reflects. His teacher seemed to exist in a state of
perfect mindfulness. A quiet, unwavering attention infused his every
action. The smallest gesture. The simplest word. Nothing, it seemed, was
ever done heedlessly.

Yet this firmness was never coldness. On rare occasions, Ven. Ñāṇavimala
would accept offerings—but always out of compassion, and seemingly from
a deep karmic sensitivity. Once, a young boy mentally disturbed had come
to meet him and offered him a simple packet of Nestomalt \[powdered
malted food drink\]. Another time, some of Shanaka’s friends from India
placed their offering before him: a dozen bananas, unceremoniously
wrapped in newspaper. To the quiet amusement of the onlooking Shanaka,
Ven. Ñāṇavimala accepted both without hesitation, seeming to know that
for these individuals, such an opportunity might never arise again, that
this act of merit carried a weight they could not otherwise gain. For
them, his acceptance was an act of kindness. For others, his gentle
refusals became lessons in detachment.

His responses were never predictable. He would usually dismiss requests
for photographs. Shanaka’s grandmother learned this first-hand when Ven.
Ñāṇavimala was on *piṇḍapāta* stopping by her house. When she asked to
take a picture, his response was a teaching on detachment; “Why do you
want to see this foul body? See the *Dhamma*.”

Yet on one occasion, when a foreign visitor who was due to leave
Polgasduwa that day requested some photographs, to Shanaka’s surprise,
he agreed. Then Ven. Ñāṇavimala turned toward Shanaka with a hint of
amusement and said, “It’s not a movie.” The act of allowing, so
different from his usual refusals, was a key insight for Shanaka. It was
a glimpse into a compassion that was not bound by rigid consistency, but
one that responded with wisdom to what was needed in the moment—whether
a sharp lesson in detachment or a simple act of kindness. As Ven.
Gnanaloka later reflected: “Even for the smallest things, I would ask
him what to do—because I knew the answer would always be different.”

As he reflected on these seemingly contradictory responses, Ven.
Gnanaloka came to see that they were not inconsistencies, but the
actions of a mind that had gone beyond rigid rules. The source of this
freedom was his very way of seeing the world, a perspective Ven.
Gnanaloka was given a rare glimpse of on another occasion. Once, Ven.
Ñāṇavimala remarked that “life is just a dream,” and with those words,
he laughed. It was not amusement, but a glimpse of how he saw through
the play of existence.

For Ven. Gnanaloka, so accustomed to Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s quiet composure,
the very quality of this rare laughter stood out in contrast.

This same freedom, which gave his practice its unbending strength, was
also the source of a simple, human tenderness. Perhaps the most touching
glimpse of this came just after Shanaka’s ordination. He had gone into
the ceremony as a layman in jeans and a t-shirt, with a long beard. Ven.
Ñāṇavimala, bedridden at the time, had been unable to attend. After the
ceremony, the newly named Venerable Gnanaloka went to see his teacher,
his head and face now clean-shaven, dressed in the saffron robes for the
very first time. As he stood before the master, Ven. Ñāṇavimala simply
gazed at him for some moments, as if pondering. Then, his very first
words were not about the Dhamma, but about his appearance. He remarked,
“With your beard gone, you’re looking different.” In that moment, it was
not the fierce ascetic speaking, but more like a spiritual father to his
son.

For over sixteen years, Ven. Gnanaloka saw this paradox again and again.
Ven. Ñāṇavimala never clung, never favoured, never softened the path to
make it easier. Yet behind his firmness there was always compassion. To
many, this intensity was too much, and they drifted away. But for those
who stayed, the lessons were unforgettable.

- **You won’t be able to take the ten precepts when you are a layman,
  but you can take eight precepts (*atthaṅgika uposatha* *sīla*) and the
  *ājīvaṭṭhamaka sīla* (eight precepts with right livelihood as the
  eighth)**[116]**.**

**2 March 1996**

**Remember the potter Ghaṭīkāra—*Ghaṭīkāra Sutta* (MN81; with
Ghaṭīkāra). Consider it carefully (he was an Anāgāmi, yet a layman).**

- What arises passes away. What arises by causes they pass away. The
  more one begins to look into the state of mind and begins to consider
  things as they are—*Paṭiccasamuppāda*—the more one begins to look in
  this essential way as a regular practice, that begins to grow and in
  this way, lot of unwholesome states come to an end. And Right View
  (*sammā-diṭṭhi)* sets in more firmly.

- May you by your example and advice, help all beings to tread on the
  path.

- Do everything with *sati-sampajañña* (mindfulness and clear
  comprehension) and also *Ambalaṭṭhika Rāhulovāda Sutta* (MN61; advice
  to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika).

- Stick to the exact words and advice of the Buddha[117].

- This way one will be under the best guidance.

- Whatever you do as a layman—a career etc.—it should be ultimately
  directed to the welfare of all beings.

**3 March 1996**

- Daily you may reflect on *kālaṁ āgameyya* (waiting for one’s
  time/death) even as a layman.

- You may continue to take *ājīvaṭṭhamaka sīla* \[eight precepts\] until
  life lasts. A lot of people do, and it will be a great support.

**<span class="mark">27 March</span> 1996**

- *Sutta* 19, 20 *Majjhima*—*Dvedhāvitakka Sutta* (MN19; two kinds of
  thought); *Vitakkasaṇṭhāna* *Sutta* (MN20; removal of distracting
  thoughts) for Dhamma thoughts and Dhamma speech in *Majjhima*
  122—*Mahāsuññata Sutta* (MN122; the greater discourse on voidness).

- Don’t build up any bondages with anybody or anything except with the
  word of the Buddha \[*Suttas*\].

- In your kuti, you might have a place for *caṅkamana* \[walking
  meditation\]. You can go up and down fully focused and reflecting 1.
  The *<span class="mark">Ādīnava</span>* \[disadvantages or
  dangers\] 2. *<span class="mark">Ānisaṁsa</span>* \[merit; good
  results\] 3. Finally, *Nibbāna* \[liberation\].

- Marvels of the ocean—*Pahārāda Sutta (AN8.19; to Pahārāda)* and
  *Udāna*—*Uposatha Sutta* (Ud 5.5; uposatha).

- <span class="mark">Daily recall the *Saṁvega* *Vatthu*.</span>

- You may learn a bit of Pāli.

- For a moment, when one attains *mettā cetovimutti* \[liberation of
  mind through loving-kindness\], it will strengthen the faculties.[118]

- Greek mythology originates from Hinduism. They had contact with the
  East. E.g. China and India, etc. So most of the myths are
  \[influenced\] from Hindu\[ism\].

- <span class="mark">Even Christ had beginnings from the East. Though he
  could not fully grasp the Dhamma as he had a Jewish background
  \[rooted in Abrahamic beliefs in a Creator-God\]. He was highly
  saintly, though he allowed drinking wine and killing
  animals</span>[119]<span class="mark">.</span>

- When old inclinations appear, one must deal with them tactfully. It is
  impossible to fight them.

- The one who captured Troy, he had to cross a stretch of ocean. People
  warned him telling him that on the one side there were abysses and
  only death could come if you turn to that side. And on the other side
  there are nymphs alluring, but they are flesh eating. So he told his
  fellow sailors to cover their ears with wax and to tie him to the mast
  and if he tries to loosen himself, then to tighten further. This was
  to be done until that stretch was passed. In the case of the bhikkhu,
  it is the practice of *Satipaṭṭhāna*.[120]

  harvest. When they decided to eat again, they recalled the painful

- You should accommodate yourself to the place and situation to create

- Saṅgha is also a formation. It lasted 2500 years, the Buddha foresaw
  the decline of the *sāsana*. That is why Vinaya was brought as an
  outside formation to support the longevity of the *sāsana*. In the
  beginning the bhikkhus were allowed to live as they wish, as most of

- Don’t do the work that is indirectly not connected to the main
  practice, in a way that you would say that after that work is
  finished, then I will start the reflection of the Dhamma. Know it

  according to that nature of things. So the practice should be always
  directed to *sampajañña*, and then to *jhāna* and attaining the path.

  foundations of mindfulness). Go through them slowly and pick the ones
  that are conspicuous at the moment. Deal with them individually. When
  they are overcome you would notice the others, then you can set about
  them as before.

- Now the noble eightfold path has to be slowly cultivated. Then there
  is *sammā samādhi, sammā <span class="mark">ñāṇa </span>*and finally
  *sammā vimutti*, then you will know how to get about (*Majjhima*
  64)—*Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta* (MN64; greater discourse to
  Māluṅkyaputta).[122]

- Know only a little experience will come initially in *mettā*
  *bhāvanā*, but as you go on, the experience will be strengthened and
  it will be a more complete experience.

- You may give your foreign friends and other newcomers, in the
  beginning, *Kālāma Sutta* (AN3.65; to the Kālāmas), and maybe
  *Dhammapada*, seeing their response; and you may find suitable ways
  and means to deal with them. For ones who are a little advanced, the
  *Mahāparinibbāna Sutta* (DN16; the Great Passing).

- As time goes on you will get the ability to help others with a more
  pure state of mind, and then you will know what is appropriate for
  them and how to use your thoughts.

- You don’t have to write a big letter, you can just write “best wishes”
  only. \[regarding writing to parents and friends\]

- Ultimately, one must prepare oneself for *kālaṁ agameyya* \[waiting
  for one’s time/death\] . For that, you slowly reduce the feelings,
  making them finer. Because after all, it is nothing but feelings,
  perception, consciousness, *pañcupādānakkhandha* (five aggregates
  subject to clinging).

- We must go in stages, first raise the mind to higher states or stages
  from the grosser level with all its gross defilements, that is the
  realm of devas, in that state there is not this kind of body. But one
  must know that all formations are *anicca*, *dukkha*, *anatta*. So
  while in this human state one can do the highest reflection and
  already transcend the whole situation of forming by attaining the
  path, etc.

- Never let the mind ponder and go back to past events etc.
  <span class="mark">Try to bring it to the present, and that is
  *kamma*</span>[123]<span class="mark">.</span>

# **Reflection 07: Final Lessons on Detachment**

Even as illness and age pressed upon him, Ven. Ñāṇavimala remained
unmoved, like a rock standing firm against wind and storm. Whether in
the solitude of forests or the sterility of hospital corridors, his
practice did not concern itself with altering the outer world but with a
steady, inward response to it through reflection and equanimity.

From early on in his monk’s life at Polgasduwa Island Hermitage, this
became evident. As the hermitage’s disciplined character began to
change, attracting a different kind of monastic and lay visitor, many of
the senior monks felt it was no longer conducive to their practice and
departed one by one. Ven. Ñāṇavimala quietly remained.

“For karmic reasons,” he once said, “we receive a particular place and
teacher. To remain there also offers support for the rest.” He held that
leaving should not be done hastily, but in consultation with the Saṅgha.
He stayed for a decade.

When he finally began his wandering life (*cārikā*), it was not from
dissatisfaction, but as a natural unfolding of the path.

After those long years of wandering, his health began to decline. The
toll of *cārikā* and advancing age showed themselves most starkly after
he returned firstly to Siri Vajiraramaya temple and then to Polgasduwa
Hermitage.

There, severe prolonged diarrhea rapidly diminished his weight and
vitality.

Characteristically, he made nothing of his condition, maintaining his
daily practice of receiving alms at the *dāna sālā*[125] and when
special requests were made giving any Dhamma advice or blessings. To
outside eyes, this decline of physical condition was a time of hardship;
but Shanaka sensed something altogether different—a palpable dispassion,
and a detachment from the body that preserved his radiance even as his
strength faded.

Ven. Gnanaloka described one such occasion as a layman at Polgasduwa
where Ven. Ñāṇavimala first lost consciousness:

“On that particular day I was washing items in the *dāna sālā* when
alarmed attendants and monks rushed to tell me of Bhante’s condition. I
found him unresponsive, his head drooping and both hands composedly
clasped in his lap.

Yet remarkably his face retained its moonlike radiance—that glow never
dimmed, creating an unforgettable image. All present were hesitant to
intervene, as he had never before allowed anyone to assist him in such
an intimate manner.

I reached for Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s belt, quickly pulled out the keys, and
ran to his kuti. I found the medicinal honey he kept and ran back with
it. Placing it on his tongue, I remember being struck by the radiance
that still seemed to emanate from his unconscious body. I could not tell
whether it was the honey, passage of time, or something else, but
suddenly he regained consciousness and spoke the following in
<span class="mark">Pāli</span>:

‘*Vayadhammā saṅkhārā <span class="mark">…</span> uppādavayadhammino;
uppajjitvā nirujjhanti, tesaṁ vūpasamo sukho*.  
(All conditioned things are impermanent *<span class="mark">…</span>*
they are of the nature to arise and pass away; having arisen, they
cease. Relief from them is pleasant.)’

‘*Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā ti yadā paññāya passati, atha nibbindati dukkhe
esa maggo visuddhiyā*.  
(When one perceives with wisdom that all conditioned things are
impermanent, then one turns away from suffering. This is the path of
purification.)’

Then he said, ‘This foul body, just lift this up.’

At that moment, I realized that his consciousness had faded while
reflecting on these verses, and it was those same reflections that
brought him back. This was my first time physically assisting him. It
was a moment of mixed emotions—on one hand bearing witness to the
helpless nature of the human body of someone so remarkable, but on the
other a most joyous experience at the rare privilege of being by his
side during this time. It was both the saddest and happiest day of my
life.”

Doctors would periodically come and check up on Ven. Ñāṇavimala at the
hermitage, and would often leave with sense of admiration. Once, a new
doctor came to the hermitage to perform a medical check-up. Unfamiliar
with Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s character and perhaps overzealous to treat his
declining health, he was met with a simple remark:

“There is no medicine for old age.”

While his mind met old age with such clarity, his body’s decline soon
became undeniable. Worn from years of austere wandering, now demanded a
level of care he had long resisted. Yet even here his practice revealed
itself—not as resistance to aging and sickness, but as a direct meeting
of them. His independence was never outwardly; it was an inner resolve.

In line with his austerity, he was admitted to a government hospital and
whilst there he remained the same: inwardly composed, outwardly simple.
His preference for public over private care was not incidental; it
reflected his lifelong consistency. For one who had rejected comforts, a
hospital ward was no different from a kuti or a forest glade—it was
merely another setting for practice.

Shanaka, who now became one of his close attendants, visited regularly,
and Ven. Ñāṇavimala would sense his presence before even seeing him.
Recognising the sound of his footsteps in the corridor, he would softly
call out, “Shanaka, Shanaka,” to Venerable
Mettavi<span class="mark">hārī</span>, who was the other close attendant
there.

Ven. Gnanaloka recalls those hospital days vividly:

“I possessed great faith but little experience in caring for anyone. Yet
I remained present, offering a kind of protection that I could.”

Even during these times, Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s independence was apparent. He
had warned Shanaka: "Don't be in the hands of the devotees." He lived by
this principle. After being hospitalized he accepted assistance, but
never gave favor to any attendant. More often, seeing there was another
attendant available, he would instruct Shanaka to return to his
practice. The lesson was subtle but unmistakable: service too must not
become a form of clinging.

Ven. Gnanaloka later reflected: *“*There was no difference between the
first day I met him and the last day I met him.*”* Outwardly he could be
close and kind, but inwardly he maintained a steady dispassion, balanced
with a universal compassion that never leaned into intimacy.

The same steady discipline carried into his mindfulness. Even within
hospital walls, he seemed to erase the distinction between day and
night. Ven. Gnanaloka recalls how at 2 a.<span class="mark">m,</span> he
would engage in walking meditation in the hospital corridors, quietly
pacing every two hours. Even when lying down, there seemed to be a
watchful awareness that carried with him.

One day Shanaka was doing walking meditation on the balcony of the
hospital ward, as Ven. Ñāṇavimala quietly watched. When Shanaka
returned, Ven. Ñāṇavimala asked him:

“Did you meet your friend… your thoughts?”

Then, after a pause, he added with a soft smile,

“Don’t overdo it. Take some rest.”

It was how he spoke of wandering thoughts, those passing visitors of the
mind. He had once advised Shanaka not to forcibly chase them away, but
to meet them gently as if they were a guest, and let them pass on their
own. Then the underlying tendency to aversion finds no ground to grow.

What stayed with Shanaka were moments like these—the peculiar way of
teaching hidden in simple exchanges.

As his teacher’s health declined, those small exchanges took on a deeper
light. Ven Ñāṇavimala later needed to stay at Siri Vajiraramaya temple
as it was easier to access medicines and appropriate care. During this
period, a striking incident left a lasting imprint on Ven. Gnanaloka.

He recalls entering Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s room and offering to help adjust
his body in bed. He replied with an uncharacteristically abrupt “No!”

Then, after a pause, he asked, “Did anything touch you?”

Shanaka was confused until he realized that stool had involuntarily
passed from Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s frail body. The moment this was
understood, Ven Ñāṇavimala said with striking clarity:

“Whether it’s inside or outside, it doesn’t make a difference.”

The body, the Buddha taught, is just elements (*dhātu*)—solidity,
fluidity, heat, and motion. Inside, outside. All the same. Nothing to
claim as ‘mine.’ Just nature unfolding.

Ven. Gnanaloka recalls “he was looking at his body with that reality,
really meaning it. You could feel it.” At first, Ven. Ñāṇavimala
objected, stating he would wait for the other attendants. But when
Shanaka remained quietly beside him, he consented.

What stood out through the years was not hardship, but the steadiness of
a life wholly given to the Dhamma. The Dhamma was his refuge—its truth
held firm where pain could not reach.

Since the first day he got a chance to physically assist Ven. Ñāṇavimala
at Polgasduwa, a thought remained with Ven. Gnanaloka: a single day of
his teacher’s existence on earth offered more worth than the entirety of
our lifetimes, for his very presence was a rare light that shone upon
both the Buddha’s Dispensation (*sāsana*) and the world. How fortunate
to encounter one who walked the spiritual path with uncompromising focus
and complete dedication. While many pursue this spiritual journey with
admirable knowledge and sincerity, Ven. Ñāṇavimala stood apart—a life
that was not an interpretation of the Dhamma, but its living expression.

**Shanaka’s draft letter to his family**

*(date unknown; likely written during the period described in Reflection
07).*[126]

“My reverence to both of you and love to Malli \[younger brother\].

I received both postcards. Reverend Ñānavimala fell extremely sick. He
showed extreme weakness of body in the last few days, but in spite of
all this he manages everything on his own. One thing is that I had the
privilege of supplying him with fruit juices. There is much to narrate
about these past few days. I would leave that for the future.

As to my classes, please do not worry. I was planning to register at
Aquinas Borella \[a popular private higher education institution\], as
the courses there start late. CBS \[another higher education
institution\] of course starts very early. Reverend Ñāṇavimala might be
admitted at any time to the Bhikkhu Ward \[National Hospital\]. If that
would take place in the near future. I would return with him. I must
stress that all this weakness and sickness, that I mentioned is
concerning his body only but that of his mind I’m sure I haven’t to
mention. He is surely a living example of this Aryan way. You must not
have any worries about me. Already I feel a great confidence as to the
success of my actual intentions in my heart.”

# **Reflection 08: Breath, Consciousness, and the Final Moment**

There were rare moments when Ven. Ñāṇavimala sensed that the conditions
were right—when Shanaka’s mind was settled and receptive—that he would
offer that he would offer teachings on the deepest truths: the
conditioned nature of consciousness. It was during one of these quiet
intervals, in the cool shade beside the library at Siri Vajiraramaya
temple, that he posed a question to Shanaka:

In the final moments, at physical death, is the arahant[135] able to
keep the attention on the breath or does it go elsewhere?

This was no idle question. Behind it lay the profound mechanics of
consciousness (*viññāṇa*) and the nature of rebirth.

In the Buddha’s teaching, this question is particularly significant
because it touches on the ultimate goal of the path: the complete end of
suffering (*dukkha*). This isn’t just everyday unhappiness, but the
deep, underlying stress that exists in every life, whether seemingly
fortunate or not—the stress of being subject to loss, the pain of
unfulfilled desire, sickness, aging, and death.

Ending rebirth is the only final solution, because even a life in a
peaceful heavenly realm is temporary. As Ven. Ñāṇavimala had once
remarked:

“Even the Brahma world[136] is suffering. One may re-arise even in the
hell realms.”

Therefore, to break this chain for good, one must see it clearly. This
means understanding what binds the process of consciousness, turning it
into the crucial link that connects one life to the next.

To appreciate the weight of Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s question, one must first
understand consciousness within the context of the Dhamma. There is the
body composed of flesh and bone, but there is a difference between a
body with consciousness and one without. Without consciousness, it is
merely a physical object. With consciousness, there is knowing, tied to
one of the six sense bases: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind.

Take the ear faculty: there is the ear and there are sound waves. Yet
consciousness does not necessarily arise. Only when there is the ear and
sound is brought into attention do the conditions align for
ear-consciousness to arise. When it arises, this consciousness is a
‘knowing-ness’ associated with that particular sense faculty. It is not
an independent entity or ‘soul’ existing on its own. The meeting of the
three: ear, sound, and ear-consciousness is ‘contact’ (*phassa*). From
contact, feeling (*vedanā*) arises: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
Alongside feeling, perception (*saññā*) may arise, recognizing and
designating what is present—for example, ‘this is a sound’ or ‘this is a
table.’ Perception also judges the feeling: for example, “this is
pleasant,” “this is unpleasant.” Such judging is itself a form of
perception. From here, pleasant feeling inclines toward desire and
greed, unpleasant toward aversion and hatred, and neutral toward
delusion.

*Saṅkhāra*[137] is the Buddha’s term for these reaction processes, and
they are born from ignorance (*avijjā*). Ignorance, here, is the very
blindness to these processes: not knowing their impermanent and
suffering nature, their cause, their cessation, or the path to their
end. A mind veiled by this ignorance rushes toward these burning
processes, continually getting hurt, drawn to them, as Ven. Ñāṇavimala
warned, “like the moths who fly into the flames.” These processes
constitute the accumulation of *kamma*—willed actions—which manifest
through mind, speech, and body as *mano-kamma, vacī-kamma*, and
*kāya-kamma*. Moment by moment, across the six sense faculties, this
continuously drives the ongoing accumulation of *kamma* and the
consequences they produce.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala taught that at the last moment of death, an object
appears according to one’s accumulated *kamma*, becoming a condition for
consciousness to re-arise. He would illustrate this by giving the
example of a virtuous businessman whose mind in this life had been
conditioned by business—whose thoughts habitually turned to trade and
transactions. Those habitual desires become the *kamma* that fuel the
final-moment object—the condition for consciousness to re-arise. Then
that person may be reborn in a life with favorable conditions for doing
business, such as being born to parents who are supportive of business.
Particular conditions follow from how one occupies the present moment,
he would say.

But what of the arahant—the one who has fully uprooted greed, hate and
delusion, without traces of craving and *kamma*?

Ven. Ñāṇavimala explained that the arahant, in that final moment, can
maintain attention solely on the breath without attachment. The breath
is simply known as it is—nothing more. Because there is no *kamma*,
there is no object - a thought - to distract attention. Because there is
no craving one doesn’t get distracted. Even the breath itself is not
attached to. With conditions absent for consciousness to arise, no
rebirth occurs. Ven. Gnanaloka recalls how powerfully his teacher’s
words resonated: “As Bhante described it, I remember imagining it
happening to me and a great peace came over my mind just from the
reflection.” “It’s deep,” Ven. Ñāṇavimala would warn Shanaka.

This explanation was given during his first self retreat with Ven
Ñāṇavimala and was the first time he came across the *Khandha Vagga* and
*Saḷāyatana Vagga*. "I was surprised that so many *Suttas* are there by
the Buddha and I became quite absorbed with it" he recalls. He
discovered in their pages the confirmation—and the unfolding meaning—of
his teacher’s words.

These texts contain the Buddha’s core analysis of experience: the
*Khandha Vagga* deconstructs our sense of ‘self’ into five aggregates
(*pañcupādānakkhandhā*), while the *Saḷāyatana Vagga* is an extension of
*Khandha Vagga* to explain experience of the world through our six
senses. As Ven. Gnanaloka reflects on these very aggregates, “Craving
acts like a glue—it binds consciousness to form[138], feeling,
perception and volitional formations, but when that glue is removed by
wisdom, the process cannot exist.”

This insight was not just philosophical. It had a practical and
liberating result.

Even modern neuroscience, with all its instruments, still struggles to
define consciousness. It looks to the brain to trace how neural
processes might give rise to consciousness. But the ancient teachings
had already revealed that consciousness does not arise randomly, nor
from matter alone, but due to specific causes—and that these causes
could be transcended.

Ven. Gnanaloka further related his understanding to the one who is one
stage below final liberation - the anāgāmi[139]. In contrast to the
arahant, the anāgāmi has cut off the lower fetters but may still harbor
subtle lust, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Even lacking gross
desire for material existence, the anāgāmi retains subtle attachment as
well as *kamma* towards the higher formless existences. This becomes the
object that conditions the consciousness to move on, which is why the
anāgāmi is reborn in a higher, formless Brahma plane; the subtle
attachment has not been completely uprooted, unlike the arahant. Thus,
at the moment of physical death, attention is not able to remain
exclusively on the breath but gravitates to the object of subtle
attachment, which is that of the equanimous *samādhi*.

Before the insights on consciousness and liberation began to unfold, his
teacher had introduced him to the *Suttas* even from their very first
meetings.

In one of these early encounters, when Shanaka described the experience
of noticing arising and passing away, Ven. Ñāṇavimala directed him
toward the *Satipaṭṭhāna* *Sutta*. The *Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta*, which lays
out the four foundations of mindfulness—of body, feeling, mind, and
Dhammas—holds a central place in Buddhist practice today. As passed down
to him by his teacher, Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies that the application of
real *Satipaṭṭhāna* happens when one is free from the five hindrances
(*nīvaraṇas* - sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, restlessness
and remorse, and doubt)*.*

He explains that this is not a matter of forceful suppression, but of
cultivating the opposite qualities of the mind - the five *indriyas*
(faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom). Ven. Ñāṇavimala
once commented to Shanaka that when he was finding reasons for needing
to leave the Island Hermitage, it was because these five *indriyas* were
not properly cultivated in a balanced way, and if they were he would
just stay on. Ven. Ñāṇavimala further remarked that monks who base their
practice more solely on the Vinaya (monks code of conduct), without the
five *indiryas* being properly cultivated in a balanced way, this
becomes a reason why they disrobe.

Wisdom is a critical component in the *indriyas*. Wise reflection
(*yoniso manasikāra*) is fundamental to this, belonging to
*Dhammānupassanā*, the contemplation of Dhammas, within the framework of
*Satipaṭṭhāna* practice. Yet, many discourses the Buddha delivered, such
as those in the *Khanda Vagga* and *Saḷāyatana Vagga* also serve to
activate this quality of contemplation. To see the arising and passing
of the five aggregates and recognize their impermanent nature. Ven.
Gnanaloka elaborates, “This insight goes beyond simply noticing that
something appears and later disappears, or that a feeling arises and
subsides. This is just an immediate noticing of impermanence. On a
subtle intuitive level, however, one sees that the very causes and
conditions that create these phenomena are themselves impermanent. In
this deeper insight, one can naturally clearly see the impermanence
(*anicca*) nature.” Since *Dhammānupassanā* is present in all the
foundations of mindfulness, Ven. Ñāṇavimala encouraged systematic
reading of various *Suttas*, allowing deeper understandings to emerge
naturally. This broader approach reveals the full richness of the
teaching, rather than focusing narrowly on one aspect such as the body.

Ven. Gnanaloka remembers an incident from his layman days when the
*Suttas* revealed their practical power in a most personal way.

One day Ven. Ñāṇavimala looked at Shanaka and, quite unexpectedly,
remarked, “My thoughts went to your cousin.” Since he didn’t usually
comment on worldly affairs, the remark struck Shanaka as unusual. His
cousin, an Air Force pilot was only a year apart in age to Shanaka and
they had grown up together more like brothers than cousins. As children
they shared toys, and as young men his cousin had confided in Shanaka.
The bond was deep, stronger even than the one he shared with his own
brother. After Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s remark, the following day a telegram
letter arrived from home calling him to come back urgently to Colombo,
without explanation. When he arrived, he found the house full of
grieving relatives— his cousin had gone missing in action and was
presumed dead.

Rather than react immediately, he quietly made his way through the crowd
to his room at the back, his mother following after him, anticipating
his sorrow. Sitting down, he turned his mind inward to the reflections
presented in *Saḷāyatana* discourses: ‘*The ear is impermanent, sounds
are impermanent, ear-consciousness is impermanent; what is impermanent
is suffering and thus non-self*.’ Hearing the distressing news, he saw
it was beyond his control—merely an arisen sound wave reaching his ear.
He began to witness his ear faculty as if from a distance as a separate
thing, and sound as a separate external occurrence, both momentary and
conditioned. The sense of “*this belongs to me, this I am, this is
myself*” then quieted. In clearly seeing this as an impersonal process,
sadness did not take hold. The mind did not shut the experience out but
saw its true dependent and impersonal nature. His mother, deeply moved
by his unshaken calm, worshipped him. Later, the full, tragic story came
to light: his cousin’s plane had been shot down over the northern war
zones[140] by LTTE[141] rebels.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala would say, “arahants see everything from a distance.”
What Shanaka was only beginning to glimpse was a form of this detached
awareness—observing experiences through this framework of causes and
conditions—an approach that reveals how the *Suttas*, when read with the
right spirit, are not just concepts but can give a direct experience of
these truths.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s advice was that “one must not overload with
intellectual grasping of the *Suttas*”. Neither rushing the reading as
too simple nor over intellectualizing them as academia or abstract
philosophy—both extremes block what the *Suttas* are meant to reveal.
Each *Sutta* provides a means for reflection (*kammaṭṭhāna*), by keeping
the mind steady on the reflection, without going too far into wanderings
of the past or future. Ven. Gnanaloka offers simple guidance: “Read as
if the Buddha were speaking directly to you. Cultivate a childlike
openness. For this to happen, one can choose to cultivate *samādhi*
separately, bringing the mind to the present moment and then read the
*Suttas*. Don’t aim for some imagined ‘*magga-phala*’ experience. Let
the insights unfold by themselves.” Ven. Ñāṇavimala taught the *Suttas*
serve as “signposts”: practical guides pointing the way forward on the
Dhamma path.

Ven. Gnanaloka observed that when yogis got a powerful insight from
contemplating the *Suttas*—like seeing that “this is not mine, not I”
they would sometimes cling to it. “Keep reading,” he would say, “don’t
stop there—because that’s the very reason it happened in the first
place. Otherwise, they may get stuck in that or just trying to get that
equanimous *samādhi* feeling again”. He adds that “it happened to me
too”.

This practice of returning to the teachings is essential. The *Suttas*
are not meant for a single, superficial encounter; they are living
instructions. In the Buddha’s time, it was through this very process of
sustained, repeated reflection that disciples awakened to the Dhamma,
often attaining final liberation.

Such reflection, done with a receptive and investigative mind, could
lead to subtle forms of support. He remembered on one occasion whilst
Ven. Ñāṇavimala was speaking about impermanence, Shanaka found himself
deeply focused on that, silently catching that insight himself. At that
moment, Ven. Ñāṇavimala would say, “just wait like that,” watching and
simply waiting as if a form of mind-to-mind communication or internal
exercise was taking place.

That subtle influence, he came to understand, was not confined by
distance or space.

At another time, while staying in the Himalayas, reading and reflecting
quietly in his kuti, Ven. Gnanaloka felt an influence—a blessing
perhaps—from Ven. Ñāṇavimala, reaching him across the great distance
supporting that insightful contemplation. Reflecting on these
experiences, Ven. Gnanaloka felt they were not a coincidence, but a kind
of connection on a ‘Dhamma-plane’. He reminds fellow practitioners
“don’t think you’re alone”, affirming Ven Ñāṇavimala’s advice said to
him—if the qualities are aligned, support comes, even from those beings
afar but on the same Dhamma-plane. Ven. Ñāṇavimala passed away not long
after this experience, while Ven. Gnanaloka was still practicing in the
Himalayas.

Ven. Upasama, another close attendant disciple of Ven. Ñāṇavimala,
witnessed Ven Ñāṇavimala during these last days take his final breath,
describing it as being taken “peacefully… in (a) fully controlled
manner!”[142] In his telling, the moment spoke for itself.

Ultimately, it all pointed to one truth. The final breath, the last
moment of attention, the condition that determines whether consciousness
re-arises or ceases—it all depends on how one has perceived the Dhamma.
Whether craving still binds, or whether wisdom has finally cut the
thread.

  will fall sick. But then only there is experience of *dukkha* in
  *Kāmaloka* (the sensual realm).**

<!-- -->

- Otherwise if you get used to the place and all its comforts, being
  looked after by the *dāyakas*. It is dangerous. Think of the first 60
  arahants, how they died and where they passed away.[143]

- First you will have to go with the teacher. Progress in the Dhamma is
  not at once, you must allow time.

- When in the jungle, don’t get frightened or excited when faced with
  animals because they perceive the state of mind. Recite the *Khandha
  Paritta*—*Ahirāja Sutta* (AN4.67; snakes) daily and act with *mettā*
  to these beings.

- **If the monk you are under (teacher’s senior pupil) does not have an
  understanding of the actual practice, then you might have to part from
  him. This must not be done at once. When such things come, you must
  call for a Saṅgha meeting. Because it is not by chance you get this
  and that one as your *upajjhāya* or *ācariya*. There is a certain
  *kamma* behind it.**

**23 January 2000**

- When you are striving and living according to the Dhamma, merit is
  made and devas in the higher world will give protection as they like a
  person who can give merit. They will follow, don’t forget that.

- Though things have changed outside, if you are determined to live
  according to the Dhamma, that will not be in vain.

- Though things have changed in Ceylon from outside, still in the hearts
  of the people the true idea of the monks is not lost.[144]

  would follow[145].

# **Reflection 09: In the Footsteps of a Master**

When Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera lay bedridden in his final years at
Parappaduwa Island Hermitage, his attendants would meet him each morning
for a blessing before their alms round. As Ven. Gnanaloka recalls, “He
would put us in a *mettā* state… In his bed, you would know that he’s
having a kind of vision. You could see that he is seeing something.
That’s very, very clear.”

These visions shifted from day to day, and his blessings became a vast
field of loving-kindness (*mettā*). He would encourage his attendants to
join him in spreading *mettā*—beginning with the local villagers and
gradually extending to all beings. He also began to include spreading it
to the “youth who have gone astray in the North”. His usual mention was
to “the fisherman who would serve” referring to the daily offering they
would get from them in their alms round.

For three consecutive days, however, a curious new phrase entered the
blessing. After the usual verses, he would say, “Even those who are
misguided in the North… they will also serve.”

The repetition of this final phrase was strange, and to Ven. Gnanaloka,
it seemed misplaced, almost puzzling—perhaps a moment of confusion
brought on by age.

The North was the heartland of the civil war, where Buddhist monks were
often singled out by the LTTE for their saffron robes. There are records
of monks being dragged from buses and shot[146], temples bombed[147],
and rural communities living in fear of sudden massacres[148]. It was
also the very region where Shanaka’s own cousin, an Air Force pilot, had
been killed in the conflict.

But two years later, Ven. Gnanaloka, found himself deep in rebel-held
territory, standing barefoot as a senior LTTE leader, a member of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the main separatist group in Sri
Lanka’s civil war, removed his cap and gently placed a handful of
*vadai* (savoury fried dumplings) into his alms bowl.

It had all begun at Parappaduwa, where Ven. Gnanaloka was serving his
teacher. Inspired by the stories of Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s solitary
wanderings, he felt moved to take up the ancient practice of *cārikā*
himself. It was a path of radical uncertainty, a practice of meeting
each moment without a plan. This was an approach Ven. Ñāṇavimala
embodied completely. During those days, when Ven. Ñāṇavimala was asked
where he was going, his reply was simple: “I haven’t decided yet. I’ll
decide when I get to the corner.”

It was this spirit of profound, present-moment freedom that so inspired
the young disciple.

When Ven. Gnanaloka asked his teacher for permission, Ven. Ñāṇavimala
gave him a resolute blessing: “Don’t worry. Your guardian *devas*[149]
are behind you.” That single line, spoken with such quiet certainty, was
more than a promise; it was a reflection of the Dhamma’s protective
power, and it was enough to carry him across hundreds of miles.

His teacher had often spoken of a principle woven through the ascetic
life: that the pure virtue of a wandering monk naturally attracts the
support of unseen beings, or *devatās*. “Those who are practising,” Ven.
Ñāṇavimala would say, “*devatās* will follow”—drawn to virtue to gain
merit. He spoke from decades of experience. There were times when a
particular food would come to mind, and then appear before him in ways
that seemed beyond coincidence. Once, arriving unannounced in a remote
village near Minneriya National Park where food was scarce and no one
could have known he was coming, an elderly woman offered him a carefully
prepared meal, she said, a *devatā* appeared in her evening prayers,
instructing her that a monk would arrive the next morning[150].

Yet Ven. Ñāṇavimala would always add a caution: wishes fulfilled in such
ways could stir further desire. A practising monk must guard his mind
with the utmost care.

And so Ven. Gnanaloka departed. Ven. Gnanaloka had no itinerary. Just a
direction—north—a rudimentary map, and the inner compass of *sati*
(mindfulness). After seeking the blessing of his preceptor[151], Madihe
Paññāsīha Mahā Nāyaka Thero, who gently told him “Do it without falling
ill. This is the time to try such things,” he began walking. He began
the journey on April 9th, 2003, and it would take him a month to reach
the sacred northern islet of Nāgadīpa. To reach his destination,
however, was no simple task. While Nāgadīpa and the Jaffna peninsula
were under government control at the time, he first had to pass through
vast areas of the Vanni region, which were still administered by the
LTTE. In total, the journey there and back would cover over 1,200
kilometers on foot, much of it through this rebel-held territory.

He would walk 15 kilometers in the early morning and another 15 in the
late afternoon. With *Sati* and *Samādhi* as his companions, the body
did not complain.

When he reached Anurādhapura, he rested for a week, asking a few lorry
drivers about the conditions ahead. He knew that entering
rebel-controlled territory would mean stepping into uncertainty, perhaps
even death. But as he later shared, “I didn’t have an army to protect
me—only the teachings of the Buddha, *mettā*, and the understanding that
this body is not mine.”

He carried with him the contemplation from the *Khandha Vagga*—the
teaching on the five aggregates of clinging. Form, feeling, perception,
volitional formations, consciousness—that is all that takes place. And
he saw those he would meet the same way: not soldiers or rebels, but
aggregates arising and passing away, like his own. Just nature meeting
nature.

He would recall: “The *khandhas* are universal, this craving is
universal, whoever decreases this craving through wisdom—with that,
dispassion will come, and they can be liberated. I feel it is a
potential everybody has. In this way I had a lot of *mettā.*”

Before crossing the last government military checkpoint, he sought out a
monk to purify his *sīla*[152] and prepare for the possibility of death.
Thankfully, a forest monk from the Waturavila tradition, fluent in
Tamil, helped him and even went to the extent of preparing a note for
alms rounds and taught him the sacred Tamil phrases: “*Subam, śānti,
samadānam*” (auspiciousness, peace, generosity).

The soldiers at the final government outpost tried to stop him[153]. It
was a plea, not an order. “Is there active conflict?” he asked. “No,”
they replied. And with that, the Monastic Rules permitted his
passage.[154]

On the other side, he was met not with bullets, but with kindness. A
senior leader, who spoke English, arranged a travel pass, offered food,
and even shielded him from publicity. Others came—militants, villagers,
children—drawn by the sight of a lone monk walking barefoot in silence.
Their questions were often simple. “*Sapada*?”—have you eaten?

He moved through areas without human habitation, across forests and dry
plains, where the only shelter was the Dhamma. When militants approached
him with suspicion, a kind stranger would often appear at just the right
moment, offering reassurance or safe passage.

A month into his journey, he reached the northern islet of Nāgadīpa and
prepared to begin the long walk back south. While staying in a makeshift
shelter built by sailors near the Dambakolapatuna Navy Camp, his mind
turned to his cousin—the Air Force pilot whose plane had gone down
somewhere in these northern waters in 1995. When the camp commander
arrived with the daily meal, Ven. Gnanaloka asked if he happened to know
anything about the crash.

The commander’s reply was stunning. Just a month earlier, local
fishermen had pulled a large piece of wreckage from their nets—it was
the engine of the lost aircraft. The spot where they found it, deep in
the ocean, was a mere three kilometers from where he now sat.

The path had not only led him through a war-torn land; it had, without
intention, brought him to the place tied to the one Ven. Ñāṇavimala had
once sent blessings to, before word of the passing had ever reached him.
He stayed an extra day. With the support of the fishermen, he went out
in a boat to the exact location and performed a blessing over the
water—a quiet, unplanned resolution.

The journey, it seemed, was a series of such unexpected moments, some of
quiet grace, others of sudden danger.

Once, a motorcycle came hurtling toward him, its rider intent on
intimidation. It veered away only at the final instant. Later, with a
soft smile, Ven. Gnanaloka said, “I was ready to die. It seemed he
wasn’t.”

There was another moment, deeper into rebel territory, when LTTE’s Chief
of Police Balasingham Nadesan arrived, inspected him, and then asked a
question that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than protocol: “Will
we ever get peace?”

Ven. Gnanaloka replied, “Peace is inside, not outside.”

“I never saw them as terrorists,” he would later say. “I felt as if I
were meeting my own children.”

This feeling was never clearer than in an encounter at Kilinochchi—a
place then known as the most heavily secured region in the North, the
heart of LTTE control. Some had quietly warned him, “Not to pass through
that and go somehow another way. If you do, do not linger there.”

Small children would peek from behind trees as he passed, their eyes
wide with curiosity at this strange sight—a monk walking alone,
barefoot, unafraid. Was he mad? How could he not be frightened? The
villagers watched too—they seemed to feel it. He had no fear.

At the checkpoint, a young cadre at a security checkpoint tasked with a
body search approached, his eyes filled with a conflict between his duty
and his devotion. He looked at Ven. Gnanaloka, and told him “Seniors are
watching me, Swamī, so I need to make physical contact with you.” He
then closed his eyes to perform the search. As he did, Ven. Gnanaloka
recalls, “I have never seen so much devotion in anyone, Sinhalese or
otherwise.”[155]

At another checkpoint when a militant asked “Are you not afraid? We are
LTTE”, his answer was quiet and unshaken: “As long as I have this
(meditative) power, I’m not afraid.”

As Ven. Gnanaloka turned south to leave, LTTE cadres followed on
motorbikes, eager to speak with him one last time. “We have no conflict
with your thoughts,” they told him.

But one scene remains etched in memory. In a village along the way back,
families had gathered on either side of the road. Their voices rose
together: “Why are we suffering, Sadhu? Why are we suffering?”

There were no words he could give. Only his presence, only *mettā*.

Decades earlier, Ven. Ñāṇavimala had taken up the practice of *cārikā*
for more than twenty-five years. When asked why his teacher had walked
for so many years, Ven. Gnanaloka would remember how he would talk about
it: “You are faced with the real truth of the *kāma loka*, then you can
see the suffering of it—and you get that real feeling of wanting to come
out of it.”

*Kāma loka*: the world as filtered through our six senses. Not just
pleasure, but all of it—the clinging, the loss, the endless wanting.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala had traversed the island south to north, east to west
three times over—walking into every province, every terrain, every kind
of human struggle.

Every kind of uncertainty.

During the Tamil insurgency of the early 1970s, Ven. Ñāṇavimala had been
on *cārikā* when he was surrounded by armed rebels who suspected him of
being a spy. They dragged him into the jungle, threatening to kill him.
Ven. Ñāṇavimala asked for a few moments to prepare his mind. Sitting on
a rock, he closed his eyes and entered deep meditation. When he was
ready, he simply raised one arm—his signal to be shot.

But no shot came. When he opened his eyes, the forest was empty. His
would-be executioners had vanished. He rose and continued walking.

“*Dhammo have rakkhati Dhammacārī*”—the Dhamma protects those who live
by the Dhamma.

As Ven. Gnanaloka reflects now, it is not his own courage or clarity
that carried him through, but the example of a teacher who had walked
that path for decades—not for what he would gain, but for what he could
give. A blessing offered wherever he walked.

For Ven. Gnanaloka, the journey fulfilled a deep aspiration. Yet he came
to see that physical extremes do not reveal the Dhamma. For that, one
needs meditative seclusion with the Buddha’s words.

His teacher had been clear: *cārikā* was not for everyone. It depended
on one’s *kamma*. You don’t walk to find the Dhamma. You walk because
you’ve found it.

But even then, one must remain unbound—even from the practice of
*cārikā* itself. The essence was freedom, not the form.

This journey, then, was never his alone. It was part of a lineage—a
living echo of one who said little, lived simply, and yet transformed
lives, one silent act at a time.

*Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera on piṇḍapāta (alms-round): Revered as the
Mahā Kassapa of the modern era, he was a legendary cārikā bhikkhu who
traversed Sri Lanka barefoot, north to south and east to west, covering
its 65,000 km² multiple times for over 25 years. (Location and date
unknown)*

**Reflection 10: A Seed Foreseen, A Path Unfolding**

In the quiet seclusion of Polgasduwa Island Hermitage, Ven. Ñāṇavimala
Mahāthera spent over a decade steeped in disciplined training under the
guidance of eminent monastic scholars—Ven. Ñāṇatiloka, Ven. Ñāṇapoṇika,
and Ven. Ñāṇamoli. These were monks who didn’t just study the Pāli
Canon—they carried it in their blood. And among the original teachings
of the Buddha, Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s roots of renunciation took hold deeply.

But the Island Hermitage was only a beginning. After eleven years, Ven.
Ñāṇavimala stepped beyond the boundaries of monastery walls and began a
life of ascetic wandering—*cārikā*—wandering with no fixed abode, no
possessions, and no dependence on even the smallest comfort. For more
than twenty-five years, he walked the length and breadth of Sri Lanka
barefoot, moving silently through village and forest, without agenda or
proclamation. Those who encountered him felt something rare—a life lived
so simply that its very presence made the Dhamma visible.

Among the many who quietly watched and listened was the young Shanaka,
he had been drawn to meditation from a young age. Reserved by nature, he
lived as a recluse even before his ordination. He rarely engaged in
small talk, even among fellow monastics, and had no aspiration for
recognition or teaching others.

Yet his teacher saw otherwise.

As a novice, Ven. Gnanaloka was once told, unexpectedly, “Your devotees
are waiting for you.” At the time, it sounded more poetic than
prophetic. Still, over the years, Ven. Ñāṇavimala would quietly prepare
him—not with formal instruction, but with passing remarks that hinted at
something more to come.

“When you happen to discourse to others,” he once said, “you must
discourse to them from their framework or language. Your idea or Dhamma
ideas—it will create an impression.”

Then, in 2001, what had once been subtle suggestions crystallized into a
clear mission from his teacher:  
“You must find a way to bring many to this path. Create separate *cārikā
p<span class="mark">iṇḍa</span>pātika* bhikkhus.”

It was a rare and weighty instruction—especially for one who had spent
his life resisting social contact, avoiding even casual interactions
with other monks. But the words were delivered without pressure, as if
Ven. Ñāṇavimala knew the moment would come by itself.

That moment arrived years later, not in a monastery, but high in the
Himalayas.

In 2015, while attempting to climb Mount Kailash, Ven. Gnanaloka faced
sudden, life-threatening altitude sickness. With no access to oxygen or
proper medical help, he began gasping for breath. As his body weakened,
there was no panic—only a deep internal stillness. He turned inward, not
to fight death, but to meet it with clarity.

And in that space between life and death, a troubling thought arose:  
Had he shared the Dhamma he had received?

This internal conflict was magnified by his private aspiration: he had
vowed to share the Dhamma he had received only after no trace of greed,
hate or delusion was left in his heart.

He realized then that sharing need not wait for perfection. One doesn’t
need to master the entire ocean to offer a cup of water. That
realization—drew him out of his long seclusion.

It wasn’t a desire to teach, but a sense of duty that emerged. Slowly,
almost reluctantly, he began to guide others—offering retreats, sharing
insights, and gently encouraging those ready to walk the path. In time,
he even began to support others in renunciation, nurturing a new
generation of monastics inspired by the same wandering spirit.

Though his own instincts had always leaned toward quietude, it was clear
the turning point had been foreseen—not by him, but by the one who had
trained him.

Looking back now, the threads are unmistakable. From cryptic blessings
to direct instructions, Ven. Ñāṇavimala had not only planted the seed
but somehow glimpsed its flowering. Looking back, he sees the
transformation in his own life as no accident—but as something quietly
shaped and anticipated long before anyone else noticed.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala did not speak of destiny. His way was to place the right
word in the heart of one who was ready and then wait, patiently, as life
brought it to fruition.

*At Polgasduwa Island Hermitage stands a small memorial stūpa,
enshrining the relics of Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera—bearing silent
witness to a life lived beneath the open sky, serene and steadfast on
the ancient path.*

**Epilogue — The Sage**

At the time of the Buddha, many who listened to the Dhamma were moved to
renounce worldly life and follow the ancient path of the sages.

In Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera, the spirit of the ancient path came
alive again—a life of quiet renunciation, lived beneath the open sky.
His footprints joined those of countless seekers, from the forests of
India to the hermitages of Sri Lanka and beyond. Wherever such lives are
lived, the way of the sage endures—serene, selfless, and unbroken
through time.

The verses below, spoken by the Buddha, encapsulate the essence of that
path—the life of the *muni*, the silent sage. They remind us that the
Dhamma is not a doctrine to be held, but a way to be lived—here and now,
in this very life.

May these words awaken in the reader the same resolve that inspired
countless seekers—to live by the Dhamma, to see clearly, and to walk the
way of the sage.

“Peril stems from intimacy,

dust comes from an abode.

Freedom from abode and intimacy:

that is the sage’s vision.

Having cut down what’s grown,

they wouldn’t replant,

nor would they nurture what’s growing.

That’s who they call a sage wandering alone,

the great seer has seen the state of peace.

Having appraised the fields and measured the seeds,

they wouldn’t nurture them with moisture.

Truly that sage who sees the ending of rebirth

has left speculation behind and is beyond reckoning.

Understanding all the planes of rebirth,

not wanting a single one of them,

Truly that sage freed of greed

need not swim,

for they have reached the far shore.

The champion, all-knower, so very intelligent,

unsullied in the midst of all things,

has given up all, freed in the ending of craving:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

Strong in wisdom,

with precepts and observances intact,

serene, loving absorption, mindful,

released from chains, kind, undefiled:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

The diligent sage wandering alone,

is unshaken by blame and praise—

like a lion not startled by sounds,

like wind not caught in a net,

like water not sticking to a lotus.

Leader of others, not by others led:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

Steady as a post in a bathing-place

when others speak endlessly against them,

freed of greed, with senses stilled:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

Steadfast, straight as a shuttle,

horrified by wicked deeds,

discerning the just and the unjust:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

Restrained, they do no evil,

young or middle-aged, the sage is self-controlled.

Irreproachable, he does not insult anyone:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

When one who lives on charity receives alms,

from the top, the middle, or the leftovers,

they think it unworthy to praise or put down:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

The sage lives refraining from sex,

even when young is not tied down,

refraining from indulgence and negligence, freed:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

Understanding the world,

the seer of the ultimate goal,

the unaffected one,

having crossed the flood and the ocean,

has cut the ties, unattached and undefiled:

that’s who the attentive know as a sage.

The two are not the same,

far apart in lifestyle and conduct—

the householder providing for a wife,

and the selfless one true to their vows.

The unrestrained householder kills other creatures,

while the restrained sage

always protects living creatures.

As the crested blue-necked peacock

flying through the sky

never approaches the speed of the swan,

so the householder cannot compete

with the mendicant,

the sage meditating secluded in the woods.”

*Muni Sutta* (Snp 1.12; the Sage)

**Appendix**

## **Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s Suggested Readings for the Path towards Enlightenment**

The *Suttas* given below form a suggested two-week self-retreat
curriculum based on guidance given by Venerable Ñāṇavimala. It is
designed for practitioners who wish to undertake a short, focused period
of solitary practice at home or in a quiet place. Follow the sequence in
order: the early texts build a firm foundation, and later texts support
concentrated insight practice. Use them with restraint — prioritise
direct practice over intellectual study.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**I. The Foundation for All Practitioners**

This section contains the essential starting points repeatedly
emphasized by Venerable Ñāṇavimala for establishing a solid foundation
in the Dhamma.

For Right View (*Sammā Diṭṭhi*):

• The Word of the Buddha by Ven. Nyanatiloka Mahāthera: Consistently
recommended as the first and most essential guide.

• *Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta* (MN 9): The Discourse on Right View, which
Venerable Ñāṇavimala advised reading “again and again.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**II. The Direct Path to Nibbāna: A Step-by-Step Guide**

The following is a specific, sequential curriculum that Venerable
Ñāṇavimala gave to Ven. Gnanaloka on February 20, 1996, describing it as
a direct, step-by-step path that was shared to Ven. Gnanaloka is a way
to “lead to Nibbāna.” This precise sequence is preserved here exactly as
it was given. Ven. Gnanaloka himself doesn’t have experience with this
path, but he relates that Ven. Ñāṇavimala had shared this based on
insights he has clearly had and feels it is an important sequence.

Step 1: The Foundation for a Noble Disciple

• *Mahānāma Sutta* (AN 8.25)

Step 2: The Gradual Training of the Mind

• *Gaṇakamoggallāna Sutta* (MN 107) & *Dantabhūmi Sutta* (MN 125)

Step 3: Understanding the Path in Full

• *Mahācattārīsaka Sutta* (MN 117)

Step 4: The Central Importance of Virtuous Conduct

• *Ambalaṭṭhika Rāhulovāda Sutta* (MN 61)

Step 5: The Development of Liberating Insight

• *Khandha Saṁyutta* (SN 22) & *Saḷāyatana Saṁyutta* (SN 35)

Step 6: Broadening the Foundation

• *Devadūta Sutta* (MN 130): The Divine Messengers, also a key text for
contemplating mortality.

• *Sāmaññaphala Sutta* (DN 2): The Fruits of the Homeless Life.

• Further Sequence on Purification: The *Suttas* from MN 7 to MN 10
(*Vattha, Sallekha, Sammādiṭṭhi*, and *Satipaṭṭhāna*) were also noted as
another important sequence to follow.

Step 7: The Final Contemplation

• *Kālaṁ Āgameyya* (Awaiting One’s Time): This refers to the final
practice of meeting sickness and death with wisdom. The key *Suttas* for
this contemplation are:

o *Salla Sutta* (SN 36.6): The Dart of Feeling.

o ***Paṭhamagelañña Sutta*** (SN 36.7) & *Dutiyagelañña Sutta* (SN
36.8): The Discourses to the Sick.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**III. Another Approach to Nibbāna: A Sequence on Purification**

As noted, Venerable Ñāṇavimala also taught that the sequence of *Suttas*
from *Majjhima Nikāya* 5 to 10 is another complete path.

• *Anaṅgaṇa Sutta* (MN 5), *Ākaṅkheyya Sutta* (MN 6), *Vattha Sutta* (MN
7), *Sallekha Sutta* (MN 8), *Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta* (MN 9) and
*Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta* (MN 10)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**IV. The Development of Insight (Vipassanā & Dhammānupassanā)**

With a mind calmed and steadied through concentration, one can then
develop liberating insight by contemplating the true nature of
experience. As highlighted in Reflection 8, this is the heart of the
contemplation of phenomena (*Dhammānupassanā*).

• *Khandha Saṁyutta* (SN 22): The Connected Discourses on the
Aggregates, for deconstructing the sense of “self.” (Includes the *Bhāra
Sutta*, SN 22.22, on the burden of the aggregates).

• *Saḷāyatana Saṁyutta* (SN 35): The Connected Discourses on the Six
Sense Bases, for understanding how all experience arises.

• *Bhaddekarattasutta* (MN 131): The Discourse on One Fine Night, which
provides a powerful practice for focusing on the present moment.

## **Venerable Ñāṇavimala’s Walking Contemplations (*Caṅkama Bhāvanā*)**

On numerous occasions, Venerable Gnanaloka (then Shanaka) accompanied
his teacher from his hut to the monastery dining hall and back. During
these walks, Venerable Ñāṇavimala would often verbalize the sequence of
his *caṅkama* (walking meditation) contemplations. The following
phrases, memorized by Venerable Gnanaloka, offer a rare glimpse into the
structured, moment-to-moment reflection of a master.

The practice unfolds in stages, beginning with arousing faith and
culminating in the direct contemplation of Dependent Origination.

### **1. Brightening the Mind**

The practice begins by cultivating faith and confidence in the Buddha,
reflecting on his boundless qualities, reciting a Pāli Gāthā or
recalling the great practitioners of the past who walked this very path
to liberation.

### **2. Grounding in the Present Moment**

After brightening the mind with faith, one returns to the present by
reflecting on the impermanent nature of all phenomena.

> *“Yadatītaṁ pahīnaṁ taṁ, appattañca anāgataṁ.*
>
> *Paccuppannañca yo dhammaṁ, tattha tattha vipassati”*
>
> *“The past is left behind, The future is not yet reached.*
>
> *But those phenomena that are present, He clearly sees wherever they
> arise”*
>
> \[This verse is extracted from *Bhaddekaratta Sutta* (MN 131; a single
> excellent night)\]

### **3. Contemplating the Body & Cultivating Awareness**

Next, one detaches from the body by mindfully recognizing its nature and
cultivates awareness in every posture.

> *“Kāyo anantādīnavo āvāso,*
>
> *Sabba roga rukkha mūlo”*
>
> *“This body is a dwelling full of endless faults,*
>
> *the root of all disease and suffering.”*
>
> \[Not a direct quote; likely inspired by *Girimānanda Sutta* (AN60)
> and *Apadāna* (PTS 2.467)\]
>
> *“Gate ṭhite bhāsite tuṇhībhāve sampajānakārī bhikkhu.”*
>
> *“A Bikkhu acts in full awareness when walking, standing, talking, and
> keeping silent.”*
>
> *“Gacchanto gacchāmi”*
>
> *“When walking, one knows: ‘I am walking.’”*
>
> \[Paraphrased from *MahāSatipaṭṭhāna Sutta* (DN22; the foundations of
> mindfulness)\]

### **4. Reflecting on Impermanence**

While walking, the contemplation deepens by examining the conditioned
and transient nature of the body and all formations.

> *“Āhārasambhūto kāyo*
>
> *Āhāra<span class="mark">ṁ</span> anicca<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> dukkha<span class="mark">ṁ</span> anatt<span class="mark">aṁ</span>*
>
> *Kāya<span class="mark">ṁ</span> anicca<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> dukkha<span class="mark">ṁ</span> anatt<span class="mark">aṁ</span>*
>
> *Sabbasaṅkhāra<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> anicca<span class="mark">ṁ</span> dukkha<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> anatt<span class="mark">aṁ</span>”*
>
> *“This body is sustained by food.*
>
> *Food is impermanent, subject to suffering, and not-self.*
>
> *The body is impermanent, subject to suffering, and not-self.*
>
> *All conditioned things are impermanent, suffering, and not-self.”*
>
> \[Not a direct quote; likely inspired by *Puttamaṁsa Sutta* (SN 12.63;
> son’s flesh)

### **5. Aspiring to Be Like the Sages**

> Reflects on calming the body, speech and mind, practicing restraint,
> understanding impermanence, and following the path of the wise ones.
>
> *“Santa kāyo santa vāco*
>
> *Santavāsu samāhito*
>
> *Vantalo<span class="mark">kā</span>miso bhikkhu*
>
> *Tādisā samaṇā mama*
>
> *Santa indriyā santa manasā*
>
> *Santa<span class="mark">ṁ</span> nesa<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> gata<span class="mark">ṁ</span> chinna<span class="mark">ṁ</span>*
>
> *Okita cakkhu mitabhāṇi*
>
> *Tādisā samaṇā mama”*
>
> *“Calm the body, calm the speech.*
>
> *Composed in peaceful dwelling.*
>
> *Like such sages, I, too, aspire to become one who is liberated from
> the world.*
>
> *Calm the senses, calm the mind.*
>
> *Their path is calm, their attachments cut off.*
>
> *They have restrained vision, they do not look far or close; they see
> just enough.*
>
> *Like such sages, I, too, aspire to become one who is liberated from
> the world.”*
>
> \[Not a direct quote; likely inspired by Sayings of the Buddha,
> *Dhammapada* Verse 378\]
>
> *“Kāya<span class="mark">ṁ</span> purāṇa<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> kamma<span class="mark">ṁ</span>,*
>
> *Abhisaṅkhata<span class="mark">ṁ</span>
> abhisañcetayita<span class="mark">ṁ</span>,*
>
> *Anicca<span class="mark">ṁ</span> nirodha
> dhamma<span class="mark">ṁ</span>.”*
>
> *“This body is old karma.*
>
> *Formed and shaped by prior intentions.*
>
> *Everything is impermanent and destined for cessation, not eternal.”*
>
> \[Not a direct quote; likely inspired by *Natumha Sutta* (SN 12.37;
> not yours)\]

### **6. Contemplating Mundane Dependent Origination**

The reflection then turns to the causal chain that perpetuates suffering
(*saṁsāra*).

> *“Avijjā paccayā saṅkhārā,*
>
> *Saṅkhāra paccayā viññāṇa<span class="mark">ṁ</span>,*
>
> *Viññāṇa paccayā jāti,*
>
> *Jāti paccayā jarāmaraṇa<span class="mark">ṁ</span> sokaparideva
> dukkha domanassupāyāsā sambhavanti.”*
>
> *“With ignorance as condition, mental formations arise,*
>
> *With mental formations as condition, consciousness arises,*
>
> *With consciousness as condition, birth arises,*
>
> *With birth as condition, arise aging and death, sorrow, lamentation,
> pain, grief, and despair.”*
>
> \[Condensed form of dependent origination; extracted from
> *Paṭiccasamuppāda Sutta* (SN 12.1; dependent origination)\]

### **7. Contemplating the Impermanence of All Formations**

Imagine what it’s like to taste the peace of cessation—the stilling of
formations—echoed in the Buddha’s final words.

> *“Vayadhammā saṅkhārā,*
>
> *Uppāda vaya dhammīno,*
>
> *Uppajjitvā nirujjhanti,*
>
> *Tesa<span class="mark">ṁ</span> vūpasamo sukho.”*
>
> *“Conditioned things are subject to decay,*
>
> *Having the nature to arise and pass away,*
>
> *They come into being and then cease.*
>
> *Their cessation is peaceful.”*
>
> \[Combination of the Buddha’s final words and the verse uttered by
> Sakka, Lord of the Gods, following his passing; from the
> *Mahāparinibbāna Sutta* (DN 16, the Great Passing).\]
>
> *“Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā’ti,*
>
> *Yadā paññāya passati,*
>
> *Atha nibbindati dukkhe,*
>
> *Esa maggo visuddhiyā.”*
>
> *“All conditioned things are impermanent,*
>
> *When one sees this with wisdom,*
>
> *One becomes disenchanted with suffering.*
>
> *This is the path to purification.”*
>
> \[Sayings of the Buddha, extracted from *Dhammapada—*Verse 278)

### **8. Contemplating Transcendental Dependent Origination**

The reflection turns to the liberating sequence that leads beyond
suffering to Nibbāna.

> *“Avijjā nirodhā saṅkhāra nirodho,*
>

**Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s Suggested Readings for Upāsakas (lay people)**

Venerable Ñāṇavimala often recognized lay people who displayed a sincere
commitment to practice. To support their efforts, he would sometimes
give them handouts—privately typed or photocopied sheets of his
teachings—as a personal form of encouragement.

Given by Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera mainly to young monks—newly ordained
or beginning to live independently. He stressed that genuine training
starts with a clear grasp of the Buddha’s gradual path
(*anupubba-paṭipadā*): from virtue (*sīla*) to concentration (*samādhi*)
and finally to wisdom (*paññā*).

take one step back and practice at that level

MN 61; *Sīla* for laypeople—eight precepts for monks—*Pātimokkha* for
ariyas - *ariyakanta sīla*. This *Sutta* is describing a different kind
of sīla which is purity in *kāya*, *vāca* and *mano* (*tīṇi
sucaritāni*). Based on this *sīla*, *pīti* will arise

MN 19 - Dividing the thoughts[158]

MN 7; Reflecting on the Buddha, Dhamma and Saṅgha leads to step by step
progress as follows: *saddhā*,

*pāmujja, pīti, passaddhakāya*[159]*, sukha, samādhi*. This process is
how one comes to *samādhi* with joy and Dhamma-understanding as a basis

MN 40; More or less the same as M7, but based on purity of the twelve
qualities

MN 64; How to practice for *sammāñāṇa* and *sammāvimutti* with *jhāna*
as the basis

## Dīgha Nikāya

### Sīlakkhandhavagga

- DN2: **Sāmaññaphalasutta** (the fruits of ascetic life)

> The newly crowned King Ajātasattu is disturbed by the violent means by
> which he achieved the crown. He visits the Buddha to find peace of
> mind, and asks him about the benefits of spiritual practice. This is
> one of the greatest literary and spiritual texts of early Buddhism.

Mahāvagga

- DN16: **Mahāparinibbānasutta** (the great discourse on the Buddha’s
  extinguishment)

> The longest of all discourses, this extended narrative tells of the
> events surrounding the Buddha’s death. Full of vivid and moving
> details, it is an ideal entry point into knowing the Buddha as a
> person, and understanding how the Buddhist community coped with his
> passing.

- DN22: **MahāSatipaṭṭhāna sutta** (longer discourse of mindfulness)

> The Buddha details the seventh factor of the noble eightfold path,

> 10, with the addition of an extended section on the four noble truths
> derived from MN 141.

- DN23: **Pāyāsisutta** (with Pāyāsi)

> This is a long and entertaining debate between a monk and a skeptic,
> who went to elaborate and bizarre lengths to prove that there is no
> such thing as an afterlife. The discourse contains a colorful series
> of parables and examples.

- DN24: **Pāthikasutta** (about Pāthika putta)

> When Sunakkhatta threatens to disrobe, the Buddha is unimpressed.
> Rejecting showy displays of asceticism or wondrous powers, he
> demonstrates his pre-eminence.

Pāthikavagga

- DN26: **Cakkavattisutta** (the wheel-turning monarch)

> In illustration of his dictum that one should rely on oneself, the
> Buddha gives a detailed account of the fall of a kingly lineage of the
> past, and the subsequent degeneration of society. This process,
> however, is not over, as the Buddha predicts that eventually society
> will fall into utter chaos. But far in the future, another Buddha,
> Metteyya, will arise in a time of peace and plenty.

- DN27: **Aggaññasutta** (origin of the world)

> In contrast with the brahmin’s self-serving mythologies of the past,
> the Buddha presents an account of evolution that shows how human
> choices are an integral part of the ecological balance, and how
> excessive greed destroys the order of nature.

- DN29: **Pāsādikasutta** (an impressive discourse)

> Following the death of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, the leader of the Jains,
> the Buddha emphasizes the stability and maturity of his own community.
> He encourages the community to come together after his death and
> recite the teachings in harmony.

- DN31: **Siṅgālasutta** (advice to Sigalaka)

> The Buddha encounters a young man who honors his dead father by
> performing rituals. The Buddha recasts the meaningless rites in terms
> of virtuous conduct. This is the most detailed discourse on ethics for
> lay people.

## Majjhima Nikāya

Mūlapariyāyavagga

- MN2: **Sabbāsavasutta** (all the defilements)

> of responses. Rather than applying the same solution to every problem,
> the Buddha outlines seven methods of dealing with defilements, each of
> which works in certain cases.

- MN5: **Anaṅgaṇasutta** (unblemished)

> The Buddha’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, use a simile
> of a tarnished bowl to illustrate the blemishes of the mind and
> conduct. They emphasize how the crucial thing is not so much whether
> there are blemishes, but whether we are aware of them.

- MN6: **Mahāmālukyasutta** (the longer discourse with Māluṅkya)

> A little baby has no wrong views or intentions, but the underlying
> tendency for these things is still there. Without practicing, they
> will inevitably recur.

- MN7: **Vatthasutta** (the simile of the cloth)

> The many different kinds of impurities that defile the mind are
> compared to a dirty cloth. When the mind is clean we find joy, which
> leads to states of higher consciousness. Finally, the Buddha rejects
> the Brahmanical notion that purity comes from bathing in sacred
> rivers.

- MN8: **Sallekhasutta** (the effacement)

> The Buddha differentiates between peaceful meditation and spiritual
> practices that encompass the whole of life. He lists forty-four
> aspects, which he explains as “effacement”, the wearing away of
> conceit.

- MN9: **Sammādiṭṭhisutta** (the right view)

> Venerable Sāriputta gives a detailed explanation of right view, the

> perspectives.

  meditation)

  suffering)

> suffering that arises from attachment to sensual stimulation.

- MN14: **Cūḷadukkhakkhandhasutta** (the shorter discourse on the mass
  of suffering)

> A lay person is puzzled at how, despite their long practice, they

> dialog with Jain ascetics.

- MN18: **Madhupiṇḍikasutta** (the honey cake)

> insightful passages in the entire canon.

Opammavagga

- MN22: **Alagaddūpamasutta** (simile of the snake)

> One of the monks denies that prohibited conduct is really a problem.

> invokes the famous simile of the raft.

- MN25: **Nivāpasutta** (fodder)

> The Buddha compares getting trapped by Māra with a deer getting caught

  footprint)

> Sāriputta gives an elaborate demonstration of how, just as any
> footprint can fit inside an elephant’s, all the Buddha’s teaching can
> fit inside the four noble truths. This offers an overall template for
> organizing the Buddha’s teachings.

Mahāyamakavagga

- MN31: **Cūḷagosiṅgasutta** (the shorter discourse at Gosiṅga)

> The Buddha comes across three mendicants practicing diligently and

> their higher attainments, they explain how they deal with the
> practical affairs of living together. But when pressed by the Buddha,
> they reveal their meditation attainments.

- MN37: **Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhayasutta** (The shorter discourse on the ending
  of craving)

- MN38: **Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhayasutta** (the longer discourse on the ending

> conditions.

- MN39: **Mahāassapurasutta** (the longer discourse at Assapura)

> The Buddha encourages the mendicants to live up to their name, by
> actually practicing in a way that meets or exceeds the expectations
> people have for renunciants.

> and teaches them four dangers for those gone forth.

- MN68: **Naḷakapānasutta** (at Naḷakapāna)

- MN75: **Māgaṇḍiyasutta**: (wth Māgaṇḍiya)

> Accused by a hedonist of being too negative, the Buddha recounts the

> pleasure.

Rājavagga

- MN81: **Ghaṭikārasutta** (with Ghaṭikāra)

> The Buddha relates an unusual account of a past life in the time of

## **Glossary**

The terms listed below are from the Pāli language—the language of the
early Buddhist scriptures—and provide the English meaning and context
for essential concepts found in this work.

**Ācariya**: A teacher or master.

**Ādibrahmacāriya:** The beginning of the spiritual life or fundamental
good conduct. It refers to the essential moral foundation for higher
practice, including celibacy, which forms the start of the dedicated
path toward enlightenment.

**Adhiṭṭhāna**: Determination or Resolution. It refers to the unwavering
commitment to a course of practice, a virtue, or a specific spiritual
goal.

**Akusala**: Unwholesome, unskillful, or demeritorious actions or
thoughts.

**Anāgāmi**: A “Non-returner”; the third of the four stages of
enlightenment, a being who will not be reborn in the human realm but in
a pure abode.

**Anāryan:** “Ignoble” or “worldling” (puthujjana). A person who has not
yet attained any of the four stages of enlightenment, characterized by
the persistent view of a permanent “self.”

**Anatta**: “Not-self”; the core Buddhist doctrine that there is no
permanent, unchanging soul or self in any phenomenon.

**Anicca**: Impermanence; the doctrine that all conditioned things are
in a constant state of flux and subject to change.

**Arahant**: A “worthy one”; a fully enlightened being who has attained
Nibbāna and ended the cycle of rebirth. An arahant, having uprooted all
delusion, no longer creates new kamma; their actions are instead termed
kiriya (inoperative) and do not produce future results, thus ending the
cycle of rebirth.

**Aranya**: A forest hermitage or monastery.

**Asubha (saññā)**: Contemplation <span class="mark">on the 32 parts
components the body made is up of</span>; head-hairs, body-hairs, nails,
teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver,
pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, intestinal tract, stomach, faeces,
bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal
mucus, synovium \[oil lubricating the joints\], urine and brain. There
is nothing attractive in nature found in these, hence one sees the
reality of how unworthy of identifying with it is. It is used as an
antidote to lust.

**<span class="mark">Aṭa</span>pirikara**:
(<span class="mark">Sinhala</span>) The traditional offering of the
eight basic requisites for a Buddhist monk, including robes, an alms
bowl, a razor, etc.

**Avijjā:** Fundamental ignorance or delusion. This is not a lack of
worldly information, but a deep-seated misperception of reality.
Specifically, it is the ignorance of the Four Noble Truths, which causes
one to see what is impermanent as permanent, what is suffering as
pleasure, and what is not-self as a self. It is considered the root
cause that drives the entire cycle of rebirth (saṁsāra)

**Bhikkhu / Bhikkhuni**: A fully ordained Buddhist monk (bhikkhu) or nun
(bhikkhu<span class="mark">nī</span>).

**Brahmā-loka / Brahma World:** A very high and long-lived celestial
being (Brahma) or realm (loka) attained through deep meditation. Despite
its peace, it is still part of the impermanent cycle of rebirth
(saṁsāra).

**Buddhānussati**: Recollection or mindfulness of the qualities of the
Buddha; one of the protective meditations.

**Cārikā**: A journey on foot, especially the traditional ascetic
practice of a wandering monk who does not stay in one place for long.

**Dāna**: The act of giving, generosity, or charity; an offering,
especially of food, to monastics. <span class="mark">Dāna</span> hall is
the place where people offer.

**Deva/Devata**: A deity or celestial being, often compared to an angel.
However, they are still mortal, unenlightened, and bound to the cycle of
rebirth (saṁsāra). While the terms are often used interchangeably, deva
is the general term for a god, whereas devatā can refer more
specifically to a localized spirit or guardian divinity.

**Dhamma / dhammas:** A term with two main meanings depending on
context. Dhamma (capitalized) is the Buddha’s Teaching as a whole, or
the ultimate Truth. In meditation, mindfulness of dhammas (lowercase)
refers to contemplating mental objects or phenomena, often grouped into
categories like the Five Hindrances or the Four Noble Truths.

**Dhammapada**: “Verses of the Dhamma”; a beloved collection of the
Buddha’s sayings in verse form.

**Dhātu**: An element or natural property. Refers to the four great
elements (‘solidity’ or earth, ‘fluidity’ or water, ‘heat’ or fire, and
‘motion’ or air) that are the fundamental components of all physical
matter. By seeing that one’s own body is composed of the same elements
as the world outside, this contemplation helps deconstruct the idea of a
solid ‘self.’

**Dosa**: Aversion, hatred, or ill will; one of the three root
defilements.

**Dukkha**: Suffering, stress, unsatisfactoriness; the first of the Four
Noble Truths.

**Nīvaraṇa**: Hindrances that obstruct meditation and wisdom. There are
five: sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and
remorse, and doubt.

**Indriya:** Faculties or controlling principles. In the context of
meditation, this most often refers to the five spiritual faculties:
faith (saddhā), energy (viriya), mindfulness (sati), concentration
(samādhi), and wisdom (paññā). The practice involves developing and
balancing these five qualities to lead the mind toward liberation.

**Jhāna**: A state of deep meditative absorption characterized by
profound stillness and concentration.

**Kālaṁ agameyya:** “Awaiting one’s time.” A phrase used to describe the
final stage of a practitioner’s path, referring to the practice of
mindfully and equanimously awaiting death. It is a contemplation of the
body’s inevitable decay, done with an unagitated mind.

**Kamma (Karma):** (Pāli/Sanskrit) The universal law of cause and effect
where intentional actions of body (kāya), speech (vacī), and mind (mano)
determine one’s future experiences. These actions are primarily
categorized by their nature and results:

- *Wholesome (kusala) kamma* refers to actions rooted in skillful
  qualities like generosity and kindness. While skillful, they are
  performed by one who has not yet eradicated the fundamental ignorance
  (avijjā), and thus lead to favorable rebirth.

- *Unwholesome (akusala) kamma* refers to actions rooted in greed,
  hatred, ○ and delusion (*<span class="mark">lobha, dosa,
  moha</span>*), which lead to painful results.

- *Unperturbable (āneñja) kamma* is a specific type of wholesome *kamma*
  related to deep meditative states, leading to rebirth in a formless
  realm.

**Khandha Paritta**: A protective chant from the *Suttas*, recited to
generate loving-kindness towards snakes and other creatures.

**Kuti**: A small hut or simple dwelling for a monk or nun.

**Loba**: Greed, desire, or attachment; one of the three root
defilements.

**Magga-phala:** “Path and Fruition.” A term for the specific,
supramundane moments of consciousness that mark the attainment of the
four stages of enlightenment. The Path (magga) is a single moment of
insight that cuts through specific defilements, while the Fruition
(phala) is the immediate result—the direct experience of the peace of
Nibbāna.

**Mahāthera**: “Great Elder”; a title of respect for a senior monk,
typically with over twenty years of ordination.

**Māra:** The “Evil One” or “Great Deceiver”; a deity who personifies
temptation, illusion, and the forces that bind beings to the cycle of
rebirth (saṁsāra). While depicted as a being who tempted the Buddha,
Māra can also be understood as a metaphor for the internal
defilements—such as greed, hatred, and fear—that a practitioner must
overcome in their own mind.

**Maraṇānussati**: Recollection or mindfulness of death, used to
cultivate urgency and reduce attachment.

**Mettā (bhāvanā)**: Loving-kindness; the meditative practice of
cultivating boundless goodwill towards all beings.

**Moha**: Delusion or ignorance; one of the three root defilements.

**Nibbāna (Nirvana)**: (Pali/Sanskrit) The ultimate goal of Buddhism;
the complete cessation of suffering and the extinguishing of the “fires”
of greed, hatred, and delusion.

**Nīvaraṇa:** The Five Hindrances; a group of five unwholesome mental
states that obstruct the mind during meditation and block the
development of wisdom. They are: sensual desire, ill will, sloth and
torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt

**Pacceka Buddha:** A “Silent” or “Private” Buddha. An individual who
attains full enlightenment on their own, without a teacher, during an
age when the Buddha’s teachings are not available in the world, but who
does not teach the path to others.

**Pāli Canon**: The collection of primary scriptures of Theravāda
Buddhism, written in the Pāli language and consisting of three
“baskets”: the Sutta Piṭaka (discourses), the Vinaya Piṭaka (monastic
discipline), and the Abhidhamma Piṭaka (philosophy).

**Pañcupādānakkhandhā:** The “five aggregates subject to clinging.” This
is the Buddha’s analysis of a person’s experience into five components:
form (the body), feeling, perception, mental formations, and
consciousness. According to the teaching, suffering arises from our
clinging to or identifying with these constantly changing processes as a
permanent “self.”

**Paṭiccasamuppāda**: Dependent Origination; the doctrine that all
phenomena arise in dependence on other phenomena, explaining the process
that perpetuates suffering.

**Piṇḍapāta**: The monastic practice of collecting alms food by walking
with a bowl.

**Piritha (Pirith)**: (Sinhala, from Pali: *Paritta*) A collective term
for a set of protective chants or discourses from the Pāli Canon.

**Poya/Uposatha**: (Sinhala/Pāli) A day of religious observance in Sri
Lanka, typically falling on the full moon, when devout lay Buddhists
often observe eight precepts.

**Puthujjana:** A “worldling” or ordinary person who has not yet
attained any of the four stages of enlightenment and thus remains bound
to the cycle of rebirth (saṁsāra). The opposite of a Noble One (ariya).

**Rishi/Isi:** (Sanskrit/<span class="mark">Pāli</span>) A title meaning
a sage, seer, or revered teacher. It is used in Hindu, Jain, and other
Indian spiritual traditions.

**Rūpa:** Form, matter, or physical phenomena. It is the first of the
Five Aggregates of Clinging (pañcupādānakkhandhā). According to the
*Suttas*, all rūpa is composed of the four great elements (mahābhūta):
the properties of earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat), and
air (motion). It also includes derived form (upādāya-rūpa), which
consists of the five physical sense faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue,
body) and their corresponding sense objects (sights, sounds, smells,
tastes, and tangible things).

**Samādhi:** Meditative concentration. A key part of the Noble Eightfold
Path, it is the practice of unifying the mind to serve as the foundation
for wisdom (paññā).

**Samatha**: “Calm-abiding” or tranquility. A category of meditative
practices designed to quiet the mind and develop deep concentration
(*samādhi*). Along with insight (*Vipassanā*), it is one of the two
pillars of Buddhist meditation; a calm mind developed through *samatha*
provides a powerful foundation for seeing reality clearly.

**Saṁsāra**: The endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth,
characterized by suffering and driven by ignorance and craving.

**Saṁvega**: A sense of spiritual urgency or holy dread that arises from
contemplating the dangers of *saṁsāra* (e.g., old age, sickness, and
death). This feeling is a powerful catalyst for dedicated practice.

**Saṅgha**: The community of Buddhist monastics (bhikkhus and
bhikkhunis); can also refer to the community of all awakened or noble
disciples.

**Saṅkhāra**: As a Buddhist term with primarily two nuanced meanings
depending on context, however the essential characteristic is that being
related to conditional phenomena.

1.  As the fourth of the Five Aggregates, define the
    <span class="mark">saṅkhāra</span>-khandha as the six classes of
    volition: volition regarding forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile
    objects, and ideas.

2.  As the second link in Dependent Origination (*avijjā-paccayā
    saṅkhārā*), it refers to *kamma*-forming volitional actions—the
    wholesome and unwholesome actions of body, speech, and mind, born
    from ignorance, that propel the cycle of rebirth.

**Sāsana**: The dispensation, teachings, and legacy of a Buddha.

**Sati**: Mindfulness; awareness of the present moment.

**Sīla**: Morality, virtue, or ethical conduct, often undertaken by
observing precepts.

**Sīmā**: Boundary or consecrated area. In monastic law (Vinaya), the
sīmā is the specific, legally established ground where the Saṅgha
(community of monks) conducts formal legal ceremonies like ordinations
(Upasampadā) and the recitation of the Pātimokkha (monastic rules).

**Sutta (Sutra)**: (Pali/Sanskrit) A discourse or sermon of the Buddha.

**<span class="mark">Swāmī</span>:** (Sanskrit) An honorific title from
the Indian subcontinent, meaning “master” or “one who is master of
oneself.” While it is most commonly used for Hindu spiritual teachers,
in Sri Lanka, it is also used colloquially as a term of deep respect for
Buddhist monks, particularly those seen as highly accomplished in their
practice.

**Thero/ Thera**: A title for a senior Buddhist monk, similar to “Elder”
or “Venerable.”

**Upekkhā**: Equanimity; a state of balanced, unshakable peace of mind
that is not swayed by pleasure or pain.

**Vinaya**: The code of monastic discipline for the Saṅgha.

# **Acknowledgement** 

This book has been a journey of faith and perseverance, made possible
only through the collective goodwill of many individuals. It was an
entirely volunteer-based effort that spanned nearly two years, from
November 2023 to October 2025.

Our deepest gratitude goes, first and foremost, to the memory of
Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera, whose profound life of renunciation is
the very heart of this work. His ascetic, unwavering example continues
to be a source of immense inspiration.

We are profoundly indebted to Venerable Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka Thera.
He not only gave his permission for this project but generously shared
the private, handwritten notes of his teacher, entrusting them to us.
Given his ascetic nature and deep commitment to solitude, meeting with
him was a rare and precious opportunity. Over the course of this
project, a small team of writers was granted several extensive
interviews—some lasting many hours—both in Sri Lanka and during his
travels abroad. During these invaluable sessions, he patiently answered
our questions, clarified ambiguities in the decades-old notes, and
reviewed the reflections to ensure they faithfully preserved the spirit
and meaning of his encounters with his master. We hope this book does
justice to his trust.

This work would not exist without the tireless efforts of a dedicated
team of volunteer editors and reviewers, both lay and monastic, whose
insightful feedback helped to shape and refine this manuscript. We also
extend our gratitude to the devoted supporters who cared for Venerable
Ñāṇavimala during his final years, and to all those who have preserved
his memory and teachings over the decades.

May any merit generated from this work be dedicated to the liberation of
all beings.

**Sri Sambuddha Mission Trust**

The Sri Sambuddha Mission Charitable Trust was established to support
meditation practitioners and propagate the Buddha’s original teachings.
The Trust is dedicated to preserving and sharing the Dhamma with
sincerity and generosity.

Venerable Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka Thera serves as the spiritual advisor
to the Trust and its associated monastery, the Sri Sambuddha Ramaneeya
Ashramaya Forest Hermitage—a serene meditation center nestled in the
picturesque surroundings of Dunumala, Sri Lanka.

The monastery regularly hosts *Saddhammadhara Meditation Retreats* for
both monastics and lay visitors. Following a framework inspired by Ven.
Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera, these retreats emphasize a quiet, self-guided
exploration of the Buddha’s teachings through direct engagement with the
*Suttas*. As Ven. Ñāṇavimala envisioned, the ultimate intention is to
inspire suitable individuals toward the renunciant path.

**Back Cover \[Draft Concept\]**

<span class="mark">For decades, a German-born ascetic walked barefoot
the length and breadth of Sri Lanka, becoming a silent legend. That monk
was Venerable Ñāṇavimala—a master who embodied the Buddha’s teachings in
their purest form. Yet, for a few precious years, he opened his heart to
a devoted disciple who kept a record of his rare and profound
instructions.</span>

<span class="mark">This Is Also In The Mind is that record. These pages
offer a unique glimpse into the living transmission of the Dhamma, told
through the intimate notes and moving reflections of Venerable
Gnanaloka. It is a story of radical simplicity, unwavering courage, and
the timeless path to liberation. More than a book of teachings, it is an
invitation to walk in the footsteps of a wandering ascetic and discover
the unshakeable peace that lies within.</span>

[1] Sinhalese Buddhist lay and civic organizations gained considerable
influence in the late colonial period, alongside the island’s largely
non-violent independence movement led by an educated middle class. This
movement culminated in the transfer of power to local representatives
and the establishment of the Dominion of Ceylon on 4 February
1948—setting the stage for a renewal of Buddhist institutional life
after over three centuries of colonial rule.

[2] They were the only Western-born monks invited to participate in the
Sixth Buddhist Council in Yangon, Burma (1954–1956), in recognition of
their deep knowledge and contributions to Buddhism.

[3] Mahānāyaka theros are high-ranking Buddhist monks who oversee and
regulate the Buddhist clergy in <span class="mark">Theravāda</span>
Buddhist countries.

[4] The Word of the Buddha: An Outline of the Buddha in the Words of the
Pāḷi Canon—Compiled, translated and explained by Ven. Nyanatiloka
Mahāthera.

[5] In the original notes, this discourse is referred to simply as
Rāhulovāda Sutta, though its full title is Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda Sutta
(MN61; advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika).

[6] This practice is about the reflection of bodily, verbal and mental
actions, reflecting before, during and after, as a foundational practice
that should be done always.

[7] Primary focus should be given to *Khandhasaṁyutta* section (SN22;
Connected Discourses on the Aggregates). Buddha analyzes the five
aggregates—form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and
consciousness—as the aggregates subject to clinging, showing them to be
impermanent, suffering, and not-self.

[8] The *Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta* (Discourse on the foundations of
Mindfulness) is a foundational discourse of the Buddha, considered
essential for the development of insight and the attainment of Nibbāna
(Final Liberation). It lays out the four objects for the practice of
Satipaṭṭhāna: mindfulness of the body, feelings, mind, and mental
objects. The two main canonical versions are the shorter *Satipaṭṭhāna
Sutta* (MN10; the foundations of mindfulness) and the longer
*Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta* (DN22; foundations of mindfulness).

[9] Primary focus should be given to *Saḷāyatanasaṃyutta* section (SN35;
Connected Discourses on the Six Sense Bases). Buddha analyzes the eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body, mind and their objects—as the domain where
contact conditions feeling and craving. He teaches guarding the sense
faculties and seeing impermanence, suffering, and not-self in relation
to the six sense bases.

[10] *Samatha* (calm abiding) meditation stills and steadies the mind.
But when drowsiness intrudes, the Buddha advised the monk
Mahā-Moggallāna to: change the object of meditation, recite/reflect on
Dhamma, rouse the body (rub the ears/limbs), wash the face and open the
gaze, attend to light, walk; if needed, lie down briefly. He later
became a chief disciple, foremost in psychic powers.

[11] Ven. Ñāṇavimala gave directions in the briefest form: “*Majjhima*
\[number\]” names the discourse in the *Majjhima Nikāya* and, when
several are given, the order to follow. The sequence “7, 8, 9, 10” is a
compact progressive training: (MN7) begins by cleansing the mind’s
stains; (MN8) guides the effacement of defilements; (MN9) establishes
right view as the framework; (MN10) sets out the direct path of
mindfulness to be cultivated throughout.

[12] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies: “Mentally” refers to experiences arising
in meditation (e.g. visions). Regard them like sense-objects: observe
without assigning value or taking them up, and see their impermanence..

[13] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies, this is referring to removing the mental
defilements (*āsavas*), by the approaches described in the *Suttas*.
This requires a certain degree of knowledge of the *Suttas*.

[14] *Jhāna* provides the clarity and steadiness of mind through which
the Dhamma is directly seen.This seeing is not conceptual knowledge but
insight born of experience.

[15] In Sri Lanka, a *Poya* day is the full-moon Uposatha observance.
Lay Buddhists typically visit the temple or a forest monastery (often in
white) and “take sīla” for the day—usually the Eight Precepts. This
long-standing lay observance deepens study, meditation, and lay-monastic
reciprocity.

[16] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies this refers to gaining approval from his
father, but being sensitive to how he is feeling as well, not just about
getting formal approval.

[17] Aranya refers to forest hermitages. *Sāsana* denotes the Buddha’s
dispensation—the Dhamma and Vinaya as lived and handed on. The statement
points not only to the impermanence of hermitages and buildings but,
more critically, to decline when practice, study, and the weakening of
virtue.

[18] Ven. Gnanaloka notes this line is a personal note—an
over-explanation of Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s teaching. “Presently arisen
consciousness and components” should be read as the immediate field of
experience—e.g., the breath together with contact, feeling, perception,
and volitional formations—as observed as they arise and pass.

[19] Ven. Gnanaloka notes this sentence is a personal note—an
over-explanation of Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s teaching. In the context of
*lokuttara sammā-diṭṭhi*, when Nibbāna is the object, “past formation”
should be understood as the bodily formation (*kāya-saṅkhāra*)—i.e., the
last breath occurring as a result of past *kamma*. \[For further
context, see Reflection 08.\]

[20] To reach the first stage of awakening (stream-entry), the “four
factors” to keep in mind are noble friendship (*kalyāṇamitta*), hearing
the true Dhamma (*saddhamma-savana*), wise attention (*yoniso
manasikāra*), and practice in accordance with the Dhamma
(*dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti*).

[21] A personal note by Shanaka—reminder of the tug between retreat and
lay duty: once outside the forest monastery, he would have to resume
study and, in time, work—engagements rooted in the sensory world.

[22] Edgar Cayce (1877–1945) was a well-known American psychic who gave
trance readings that purported to reveal individuals’ past lives. In the
book Many Mansions (1952) by Gina Cerminara, it documents Cayce’s work
on karma and reincarnation as a cause for present-life conditions.

[23] Ven. Ñāṇavimala related that, with a developed *Satipaṭṭhāna*
practice, recollections of past lives began to occur. One such
recollection revealed the origin of his lifelong migraines: in a former
life during the time of the Crusades he had been a German soldier
fighting Romans in a German village; a short Roman soldier approached,
and he struck this Roman soldier on the head with a club, killing him.
He noted his own unwholesome act, following this insight on *kamma,* the
migraines subsided. As an additional comment, Ven. Ñāṇavimala would
stress the importance of grounding oneself in *Satipaṭṭhāna*
(mindfulness), stating that the practice provides the necessary mental
balance to confront often overwhelming past life recollections. ‘It was
(consciousness)’ refers to Ven Ñāṇavimala regarding these experiences as
that of the working of consciousness.

[24] Composed around the beginning of the Common Era, and of unknown
authorship, the *Milindapañha* is set up as a compilation of questions
posed by the Indo-Greek King Milinda (identified as King Menander of
Bactria) to a revered senior monk named Nāgasena. Widely revered for its
clear analogies and probing treatment of issues like self/no-self,
*kamma*, and rebirth—an early meeting of Hellenistic and Buddhist
thought.

[25] Ven. Gnanaloka states that Ven. Ñāṇavimala would sometimes say this
when Shanaka was leaving his kuti or was returning back to Colombo. Ven.
Ñāṇavimala used this statement to emphasize that spiritual unity is
solely determined by mental purity, not physical proximity. The Buddha
could see a sincere seeker practicing in the distant. Whereas a person
full of defilements (*kilesas*) is far away, even if touching the
Buddha’s robe.

[26] Sri Lankan forest hermitages: Galduwa = Galduwa Aranya Senasanaya
aka Sri Gunawardhana Yogasramaya (Ambalangoda); Vaturavila = Wathuruwila
Aranya Senasanaya (Galle), Tapovana (Angoda) = Gothama Thapowanaya
(Colombo), Kalugala = Kalugala Aranya Senasanaya (Kalutara District).
For more information, refer to Buddhist Forest Monasteries and
Meditation Centres in Sri Lanka: A Guide for Foreign Buddhist Monastics
and Lay Practitioners, by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita.

[27] Ven. Gnanaloka suggested the likely source: This may refer to the
German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, who told of a man who, upon
seeing a naked woman, felt desire, but after noticing an open ulcer on
her body, was so struck by the reality of decay that he abandoned
worldly life to live as a hermit in Egypt.

[28] Ven. Gnanaloka was unsure of the source. The anecdote bears
resemblance to two distinct historical accounts: that of Queen Anne
Boleyn (executed 1536), whose head and body were reportedly placed in a
makeshift chest; and that of Empress Isabella of Portugal (d. 1539),
whose disfigured corpse is said to have prompted Duke Francis Borgia to
renounce worldly life.

[29] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies—he has liked studies in a previous life,
and supported someone to study in that life, perhaps even forcing it
onto somebody. This consequence of *kamma* is coming back to him in this
life with his father pressuring him to focus on his studies. He also
adds that if his father supports him in the spiritual way, he will get
similar support in the future.

[30] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies—what you are experiencing is related to
your internal world such as defilements and so on.

[31] Refers to the practice highlighted in the *Ambalaṭṭhika Rāhulovāda
Sutta* (MN 61; the advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika).

[32] Ven. Ñāṇavimala advised Shanaka to seek employment in fields like
the Red Cross, civil service, or as a carer/attendant. The emphasis was
on choosing a livelihood (*ājīva*) that aligned with the Dhamma (Right
Livelihood) and left ample time for practice, rather than pursuing large
monetary gain. Such work generates wholesome *kamma*.

[33] Mahānāma was a prominent Sakyan layman and a relative of the
Buddha, known for asking practical questions about how a layperson can
cultivate faith and virtue. The practices often discussed in these
discourses include the recollections (*anussati*) of the Buddha
(*Buddhānussati*), the Dhamma (*Dhammānussati*), and the Saṅgha
(*Saṅghānussati*), as well as the cultivation of loving-kindness
(*mettā*) and the perception of impermanence (*anicca saññā*). These
teachings can be found in several discourses addressed to him: AN 6.10;
AN 8.25; AN 11.11; AN 11.12; SN 55.21; SN 55.22; SN 55.37.

[34] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies: The book ‘*The Word of the Buddha*’,
presents the essence of the Dhamma primarily through direct excerpts
from the early Buddhist texts. However, Ven. Ñāṇatiloka also included
brief explanatory passages and summaries drawn from the Abhidhamma and
the commentarial understanding. Ven. Ñāṇavimala encouraged Shanaka to
focus just on the presentations of the early texts themselves.

[35] This is Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s remark regarding the previous entry notes
about marriage & work, saying that those were only suggestions, but
giving Shanaka the freedom to choose what he thinks he should do.

[36] Shanaka was gathering a lot of information at that time about
*Suttas* and different ways of understanding—so his questioning was
about why he was gathering all this Dhamma knowledge.

[37] Ven. Ñāṇavimala encouraged monks who aimed for the ultimate goal of
*magga-phala* (the paths and fruits of liberation) to study the *Khandha
Saṁyutta* (SN 22; Connected Discourses on the Aggregates) and the
*Saḷāyatana Saṁyutta* (SN 35; Connected Discourses on the Six Sense
Bases).

[38] These teachings are found in several discourses given to Mahānāma,
the Sakyan prince and cousin of the Buddha, including: AN 6.10; AN 8.25;
AN 11.11; AN 11.12; SN 55.21; SN 55.22; SN 55.37.

[39] This is a reference to the booklet ‘The Practice of Loving-Kindness
(Mettā)’, compiled and translated by Ven. Ñāṇamoli Thera. A British
Theravāda Buddhist monk and translator of Pāli literature, he was also
Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s Pāli teacher. Ven Gnanaloka clarifies that Ñāṇamoli
Thera describes in the book “where you change *mettā* to *Khandha*
contemplation”. This was how Ven. Ñāṇavimala practised *mettā.*

[40] *Sati-sampajañña* refers to mindfulness and clear comprehension —
the continuous awareness (sati) of body, feelings, mind, and phenomena,
together with the discernment/clear knowing (sampajañña) - *Sati Sutta*
(47.35. Mindful).

[41] On numerous occasions, Shanaka accompanied his teacher from his hut
to the monastery dining hall, where Venerable Ñāṇavimala would verbalize
his *caṅkama* (walking meditation) contemplations. These exact phrases,
memorized by Shanaka, are presented in the appendix.

[42] Venerable Gnanaloka clarifies that when a meditator gains a moment
of clarity while reading or reciting the teachings, they should not get
lost in wishing for it again. Instead, they should focus on diligently
practicing the very things that led to that insight.

[43] While all of the *Suttas* in the *Majjhima Nikāya* (MN) are
valuable, the first ten (from Mūlapariyāya Sutta to Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta)
are especially recommended for meditators as they lay a foundational
understanding of the core principles of the Dhamma that lead directly to
the path of liberation.

[44] “Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all
mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering
follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.” (Dhp1)

[45] Māra is also known as the “Great Deceiver” or the “Evil One,” that
embodies temptation and illusion and seeks to distract the spiritual
practitioner from the path to liberation.

[46] In 1971, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a Marxist and
anti-imperialist youth movement, launched an armed uprising with
coordinated attacks on police stations across Sri Lanka. The revolt was
crushed within weeks but left thousands dead and many imprisoned.

[47] The phrase ‘*Budu putha*’ (blessed as a Buddha) is a fairly common
Sinhalese term of endearment used to express that the child is precious
or beloved in a moment of great joy.

[48] *Sīla* (moral conduct): For lay followers, *Sīla* is primarily
practiced by observing the Five Precepts: abstaining from killing,
stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxicants.

[49] *Kataññu Sutta* (AN2.32; Gratitude)

[50] To Ven Ñāṇavimala there was no second best to knowing Pāli, that
was the best way to understand the Buddha. Regardless of how good they
are, translators’ views invariably get projected into their
translations, distorting meaning to some degree. He encouraged Shanaka
to learn Pāli. However he directed Shanaka to the *Suttas* through
English translations and Shanaka/Ven. Gnanaloka would rely on them as
his primary source of meaning.

[51] Refers to acquiring knowledge of spiritual literature just for
knowledge sake.

[52] Ven. Gnanaloka elaborates: With *sīla* and *saddha* (faith) and
*cāga* (generosity), you stay with good activities— you’re elevated to a
deva state of existence. Then in such a state of mind you practise the
Dhamma.

[53] The five spiritual faculties (pañcindriyāni) are inner strengths
that sustain progress on the path: saddhā (faith or confidence), viriya
(energy or effort), sati (mindfulness), samādhi (concentration,
including the four jhānas), and paññā (wisdom or insight into the true
nature of phenomena)—*Paṭhamavibhaṅga Sutta* (SN48.36; Analysis (1))

[54] The Three Protections refer to the recollection of refuge in the
Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha.

[55] The body’s impure nature, Ven. Gnanaloka explains, arises from past
defiled thoughts—due to greed, hate and delusion. It is a result of
*kamma*, that this body has taken the form it has. “Why is it
repulsive?” he asks. “Because it’s created by repulsive thoughts. He
means that you have to picture the reality of how gross it is.” The
reflection is meant for clear seeing: one cannot observe what one is
attached to. By reflecting upon the body’s gross nature, a necessary
distance for insight is created— “because you cannot observe something
that you are attached to.” When thoughts are more refined, the resulting
*kamma* is also more refined, giving rise to subtler bodies of
existence. Yet, all remain bound by the same law of arising and passing
away.

[56] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies: the teachings in the *Rāhulovāda Sutta*
(about bodily, verbal and mental actions)—this should be done during the
whole day. In the evening do loving kindness meditation. Reflect upon
impermanence as understood through the *Suttas*—applying it to the five
aggregates of clinging. Reflect on impermanence when doing walking
meditation as well.

[57] *Bahussuta* (Pāli) literally means “much-heard” — i.e., well-read
or extensively acquainted with the *Suttas*. When Ven. Ñāṇavimala says
“Bahussuta is important,” he is emphasizing that close and repeated
study of the Buddha’s discourses strengthens right view, supplies the
practitioner with suitable objects for reflection, and supports
practice.

[58] Ven. Gnanaloka clarified that this was a reference to a trend,
known at the time, of business leaders using meditative concentration
developed in places like Rishikesh for the purpose of worldly
manifestation. Ven. Ñāṇavimala, who had direct experience with this
concentration power from his time as a corporate director in his lay
life, was adding the crucial teaching that all such achievements are
ultimately impermanent and “come down very fast.”

[59] Ven. Gnanaloka recalls a visitor from Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s very
hometown in Germany came to Polgasduwa, yet his teacher showed no
special reaction or emotion. This unwavering restraint starkly
illustrated the principle of reducing bonds and ties with all people and
places, even those of profound personal significance.

[60] Ven Gnanaloka clarifies, by giving the example that someone may
even think they have become enlightened—don’t assume because it may also
be wrong. He recommended better to have discussions, which may give
different perspectives on what you are experiencing.

[61] Bojjhanga Samyutta (SN 46): A section of the Connected Discourses
where the Buddha teaches the Seven Factors of Awakening—mindfulness,
investigation (clear seeing), energy, joy, calm, concentration, and
equanimity.

[62] Ven. Gnanaloka explains how Ven. Ñāṇavimala explains that
equanimity is the highest conscious experience. He would say based on
that you have the formless states.

[63] The original writes ‘(theoretical grasping),’ however, the meaning
is to get a theoretical foundation.

[64] The five hindrances are mental obstacles that cloud understanding
and obstruct concentration: kāmacchanda (sensual desire), vyāpāda (ill
will), thīna–middha (sloth and torpor), uddhacca–kukkucca (restlessness
and remorse), and vicikicchā (doubt).

[65] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies, the idea is to not dwell or brood over
troublesome life situations, know that it is from consequences of past
*kamma* and those consequences will also pass. Rather one should take
care not to create new unwholesome *kamma*.

[66] Original transcript written as ‘turn back’; “stick to an attainment
or turn back from effort.”

[67] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies: as people’s virtue (*sīla*) declines,
sickness increases in the world. This relates to the principle that
immoral conduct (*akusala kamma*) serves as a root cause for disease.
The canonical connection between the decline of morality and the
increase in sickness and shortening of lifespan is detailed in the
*Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta* (DN 26).

[68] The eight requisites of a monk are three robes, almsbowl, razor,
needle/thread, belt & water strainer.

[69] The Dhammapada is a revered collection of the Buddha’s verses on
ethical and mental cultivation, drawn from the Pāli Canon.

[70] The five contemplations, as found in the *Upajjhāya Sutta* (AN
5.57), are five facts the Buddha taught for daily reflection: that one
is subject to aging, illness, and death and has not gone beyond them;
that one will be separated from all that is dear; and that one is the
owner and heir of one’s own actions (*kamma*). This is also commonly
found in Sinhala chanting texts, such as the Maharagama Pirith Book (the
English equivalent being ‘The Mirror of the Dhamma’ compiled by
Venerable Nārada Mahāthera and Venerable Kassapa Thera).

[71] Ven. Ñāṇavimala stresses this reflection of bodily, verbal and
mental actions, reflecting before, during and after, as a foundational
practice that should be done always. Ven. Gnanaloka comments “I’ve
noticed that those who have developed *samādhi*, they have that
developed in their mind (also).” Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s advice about doing
things “slowly, mindfully, carefully” goes with this. Ven. Gnanaloka
recalls a rishi he once met in India that used to write what bad
thoughts he would have everyday within a cave wall. Over time it
gradually became zero.

[72] The Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s emphasis here is on rejecting practises that
deviate from the teachings found in the *Suttas* such as rituals. He
however cautioned against being openly critical, as noted on 21st April
1994 about the danger in doing that - “even what is left will
disappear.” Instead one must not encourage it is the best approach.

[73] Venerable Mahākassapa and Venerable Bhaddā Kapilānī, both Arahants,
were once husband and wife who lived in celibacy and later renounced
household life by mutual consent.

[74] At that time Shanaka was pursuing his higher studies, and Ven.
Ñāṇavimala’s comment “do your studies properly” is regarding that,
seeing that Shanaka was perhaps neglecting this aspect.

[75] Ven. Ñāṇavimala would also add to this that there is also a *kamma*
in being in solitude. In other words, do not attach to the solitude, or
don’t have to try and continuously long for it, but these conditions may
arise depending on conditions.

[76] Referring to the Buddha’s last words before his
passing—*Mahāparinibbāna Sutta* (DN16; the Great Passing).

[77] “You must sometimes accomodate” - means one must learn to be
flexible, sometimes it may seem like one is even going with the current,
but slowly gradually directing it according to the conditions, without
trying to cut across directly. In a practical real world sense, this may
appear as they have to take a decision such as taking a job or duty in
marriage, in order to fulfill a certain worldly responsibility. However
even in the face of those decisions, one must gradually steer it
tactfully towards the goal.

[78] Recommended by Ven. Ñāṇavimala was ‘The Mirror of the Dhamma: A
Manual of Buddhist Chanting and Devotional Texts’, compiled by Nārada
Thera and Bhikkhu Kassapa. This English-language manual served a similar
function to the traditional Sinhala Vat Pirith Potha, published by the
Siri Vajiragnana Dharmayathanaya Temple at Maharagama.

[79] Venerable Ñāṇavimala’s advice was directly related to Shanaka’s
service to him during his final years. He taught that while physical
assistance creates merit, the highest form of merit is gained through
the disciple’s own sustained purification of mind in meditation.

[80] This statement reflects the reverse sequence of *paṭiccasamuppāda*
(dependent origination), showing the cessation aspect
(*paṭiloma-paṭiccasamuppāda*). When *avijjā* (ignorance) ceases,
*saṅkhārā* (volitional formations) cease; with the cessation of
formations, there is no bhava (becoming), and consequently no *jāti*
(birth), *jarā* (aging), *vyādhi* (sickness), or *maraṇa* (death). The
phrase “What doesn’t arise doesn’t pass away” expresses the realization
of *nibbāna*—the unconditioned state, free from arising and ceasing.

[81] In the Theravāda tradition, Dhamma kāya means “embodiment of
Dhamma.” Like the Buddha, even realized teachers cannot make another
practice or attain—they can only point out the way through the Dhamma
they have realized.

[82] Poya Day is a public holiday in Sri Lanka, and this instruction
emphasizes dedicating the full day to intensified practice.

[83] Refer to Notes; Chapter 1, 18th April 1994 for more description
regarding his past life recollections.

[84] For a detailed account refer to ‘Pure Inspiration; Venerable
Ñāņavimala Mahāthera—Recollections Of His Life, Practice And Teachings.’

[85] The *Khandha Paritta* is a protective chant taught by the Buddha to
safeguard practitioners from dangerous creatures, such as snakes, by
radiating thoughts of universal loving-kindness (*mettā*).

[86] Kudumbigala Aranya Senasanaya is an ancient forest monastery near
Okanda on the edge of Kumana National Park, traditionally dated to the
3rd century BCE (King Devanampiyatissa).

[87] These teachings are found in several discourses given to Mahānāma,
the Sakyan prince and cousin of the Buddha, including: AN 6.10; AN 8.25;
AN 11.11; AN 11.12; SN 55.21; SN 55.22; SN 55.37.

[88] An acquaintance once told Shanaka that, in a past life, he and Ven.
Ñāṇavimala had studied under an elder named Ven. Saddhatissa during an
ancient period when Buddhism was flourishing in Sri Lanka. When asked
about it, Ven. Ñāṇavimala gently set aside such past-life claims,
bringing him back to the present and directing his attention to the
Dhamma.

[89] ‘(Maybe an attainment etc.)’ was Shanaka’s own real-time
interpretation. Ven. Ñāṇavimala himself did not make such a claim and
consistently discouraged any focus on attainments, advising instead to
simply continue the practice.

[90] The *Mātugāma Sutta* (SN 37.1) details qualities that appeal to
men, serving as a monastic aid for contemplating the danger of sensual
attachment (*kāma ādīnava*). The canonical counterpart, listing
qualities that appeal to women, is the *Purisa Sutta* (SN 37.2).

[91] Ven. Gnanaloka recalls Ven. Ñāṇavimala relating that, during his
school days, he was especially drawn to a particularly attractive girl.
He explained that this sense of closeness and attraction to certain
people—and even particular places—is due to being closely connected in a
past life. Ven. Ñāṇavimala cautioned Shanaka not to give into such
feelings or try to seek them out to try and thinking to make them
permanent, because they are merely past *kamma*. Being blindly driven by
them only ensures one is sucked into continuing that bondage in
*saṁsāra*.

[92] The story, in the *Nanda Sutta* (*Udāna* 3.2), is about using one
desire to overcome another. The Buddha promised Ven. Nanda 500 celestial
women to motivate him to stay a monk, as he was struggling with lust for
his fiancée. This promise was a skillful trick: it gave Ven. Nanda the
drive to practice until he achieved Arahantship. He realized all desire,
whether for his fiancée or the celestial women, was a form of
bondage—and he chose liberation instead.

[93] The daily practice of a bhikkhu is centred on overcoming the five
hindrances (pañca nīvaraṇāni): sensual desire, ill will, sloth and
torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt—by cultivating the five
spiritual faculties (pañcindriyāni): faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom.

[94] *Ariyakanta sīla* — “virtue dear to the Noble Ones”; the purity of
moral conduct that is cherished and praised by the Noble Disciples
(ariya), forming the foundation for the higher training in concentration
and wisdom.

[95] The original note mentioned this individual by name; it has been
changed to ‘a yogi’ to protect their privacy.

[96] *Bhāvanā* is the exercises of purifying the mind such as reflecting
on the *Suttas* or *mettā* and so on.

[97] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies that the “actual nature of function”
refers to the practice of applying the *Suttas* directly to one’s own
experience, rather than treating them as abstract philosophy. This
process cultivates a “dhamma picture” in the mind’s eye—an intuitive
understanding that arises from the “eye of wisdom.” This wisdom is
developed by using the *Suttas* as “signposts” for analysis. However, to
prevent this analysis from becoming purely intellectual, it must be
anchored in the present moment. This grounding is achieved by repeatedly
returning to *Kāyagatāsati* (mindfulness of the body). When this
balanced practice leads to a state of *samādhi* (concentration), it is a
sign that one is cultivating the correct “dhamma picture.” This is a
form of “right tuning,” where the mind becomes steady and free from the
hindrances.

[98] Minneriya is a large national park in Sri Lanka, a vast wilderness
with very few inhabitants. Receiving an unsolicited lunch pack while on
*cārikā* in such a remote area is highly improbable. He related the
story: Ven. Ñāṇavimala arrived unannounced where food would be unlikely.
Yet an elderly woman offered him a carefully prepared lunch, explaining
that a *devatā* had appeared to her the previous night during her
chanting, instructing her to prepare a meal for a bhikkhu who would
arrive the next morning.

[99] This refers to the personal responsibility to continue the lineage
of practice for the sake of future generations. As Ven. Gnanaloka
clarifies, the warning is not to be the person who breaks the chain of
practice passed down from a teacher, thus ensuring the path remains open
for others. He gives the example, “my teacher went on a certain path, if
I don’t go on that path and stop, then others also will stop and it will
stop.” (See the *Makhadeva Sutta*, MN 83 for the classical origin of
this theme).

[100] The first account refers to *Raṭṭhapāla Sutta* (MN 82; on
Raṭṭhapāla), and the second to *Saṅgāmaji Sutta* (Ud 1.8; with
Saṅgāmaji).

[101] An anagārika is a person who has given up most or all of their
worldly possessions and responsibilities to commit full-time to Buddhist
practice. It is a midway status between a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī and
laypersons.

[102] “\[Buddha\] tried to impart to those who sought it, and never
forced it upon others. He never compelled or persuaded people to follow
him, for compulsion and coercion were foreign to his method of
teaching.”— Piyadassi Mahā Thera, The Buddha’s Ancient Path.

[103] These teachings are found in several discourses given to Mahānāma,
the Sakyan prince and cousin of the Buddha, including: AN 6.10; AN 8.25;
AN 11.11; AN 11.12; SN 55.21; SN 55.22; SN 55.37.

[104] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies about the statement; “otherwise one may
get on, making all these things fall off”. This refers to the one who
does not have such an obligation to help people, one can just continue
the practice and allow that sense of needing to find people to help to
“fall off”. One should not concern oneself with that, because these come
out of karmic reasons.They (the sense of imagined duty) themselves are
just feelings, perceptions, not to be regarded as ‘mine’ or ‘I’.

[105] *The Raṭṭhapāla Sutta* (MN 82) recounts the story of Raṭṭhapāla, a
wealthy young man who renounced against his parents’ wishes to become a
monk. His parents later tried to persuade him to disrobe, but Raṭṭhapāla
used the opportunity to teach them the Dhamma. The context here is to
advise acting with firm conviction when the time is right, but always
maintaining harmony.

[106] The term ‘women’ is used here as it reflects the specific monastic
context of the Buddha’s original advice to his chief attendant and
cousin brother Ven. Ānanda. While the example is framed for male
renunciants, the essential teaching is a universal one for any
practitioner: to cultivate sense restraint when faced with sensual
attraction.

[107] Brahmaloka — the heavenly realms of form and formless existence
inhabited by beings who have attained high meditative states (jhānas).
Though long-lived and peaceful, these realms are still within saṃsāra
(the cycle of birth and death) and thus impermanent.

[108] Ven. Ñāṇavimala explained that *bhāvanā* (meditation) is not
simply about being able to sit for hours. He cautioned that progress
stagnates when sitting lacks the right foundation, as some can sit for
long periods and still not advance in the Dhamma. The essential
preparation lies in reading and contemplation, which builds the
necessary foundation of wisdom and actively contributes to the quality
of *samādhi*.

[109] Some references to the Sutta Nipāta in the original notes were
misclassified or contained minor errors in sutta or verse numbering.
These have been reviewed and corrected for accuracy.

[110] The following collections—from SN50 through SN55—describe
successive stages of mental development and provide a gradual training
that culminates in the attainment of stream-entry (sotāpatti).

[111] These *Suttas* are all found in the *Vedanā Saṁyutta* (the
connected discourses on feeling) of the *Saṁyutta Nikāya*. They deal
with the nature of feelings (*vedanā*) and how to relate to them,
particularly in the context of pain, illness, and suffering.

[112] This instruction summarises a progressive path of practice based
on canonical sources. The Mahācattārīsaka Sutta (MN117; the great forty)
outlines the complete structure of the Noble Eightfold Path leading
towards concentration (jhāna). The Khandha Saṁyutta (SN22; connected
discourses on the aggregates) provides insight into the five aggregates
as subjects of clinging, supporting insight into non-self. The following
collections—from SN50 through SN55—describe successive stages of mental
development: the cultivation of the five spiritual powers (Balasaṁyutta,
SN50), the bases of spiritual power (Iddhipādasaṁyutta, SN51),
mindfulness meditation and its fruits (Anuruddhasaṁyutta, SN52), the
absorptions (Jhānasaṁyutta, SN53), mindfulness of breathing
(Ānāpānasaṁyutta, SN54), and finally, the qualities leading to
stream-entry (Sotāpattisaṁyutta, SN55). Together, these provide a
gradual training that culminates in the attainment of stream-entry
(sotāpatti).

[113] The phrase kālaṁ āgameyya literally means “to await one’s time (of
death).” In the context of practice, it signifies a state of inner
preparedness and equanimity toward death—a serene acceptance that arises
when craving and clinging have been weakened. It does not imply
passivity or resignation, but rather the culmination of insight
(*vipassanā*) and detachment, where the practitioner lives mindfully,
ready to face death without fear or regret.

[114] Ven. Gnanaloka elaborates: *<span class="mark">Rāhulovāda</span>*
*Sutta aka Ambalaṭṭhikarāhulovāda Sutta (MN61)*—the three ways of
conduct—this continuous self-reflection should be done the whole day,
using it at night to help reflect on what you have done— from body,
thoughts, words and deeds. Then determine the next day also not to do
it, focusing on how to avoid that. When you are reflecting like this,
one can get into a *samādhi*, and then proceed to attain *jhāna* (or
meditative concentration) through *mettā*. Doing this before sleep,
pushing to the point until one knows when the body needs sleep, then
allows the body to naturally fall asleep. This kind of sleep reduces
your subconscious inclinations and *kamma*.

[115] This refers to the Buddha’s counsel to Ānanda in the
*Mahāparinibbāna Sutta* (DN16) regarding *mātugāma* (women): do not see;
if seen, do not speak; if speech is required, maintain full mindfulness.
It is a renunciant’s discipline of sense restraint—a practical safeguard
against sensual desire and a protection for concentration—not a blanket
moral judgment.

[116] The five precepts are the basic moral code for daily conduct. The
eight precepts (*aṭṭhaṅgika uposatha sīla*) are a temporary vow of
higher spiritual discipline, requiring full celibacy, abstinence from
food after noon, and the avoidance of personal adornment and
entertainment.

[117] Ven. Ñāṇavimala adhered strictly to the *Sutta Piṭaka* as the
complete guide for human liberation. He once commented on the detailed
analytical doctrine, stating, ‘Abhidhamma is for the devas,’ implying
its intricate framework was primarily suited for celestial beings, while
the practical path for human effort lay in the *Suttas*.

[118] *mettā cetovimutti*—the liberation of mind through
loving-kindness—is said to temporarily purify and uplift consciousness,
strengthening the five spiritual faculties (indriya): faith, energy,
mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. While not a final liberation,
this wholesome release (*cetovimutti*) powerfully supports the
development of these faculties toward full emancipation— *Aṭṭhakanāgara
Sutta* (MN52; the man from Aṭṭhakanāgara).

[119] Ven. Ñāṇavimala noted that the Three Wise Men (Magi), said to come
from the East, were spiritual sages (rishis) who recognized Christ as a
“spiritual king.” This exchange, facilitated by the ancient Silk Route,
suggested that established Eastern ethical principles—non-violence and
compassion—helped shape early Christian ethics. The main point is that
these core ethics had Eastern resonances, even if later religious
practices diverged from the strict morality (sīla) of the Buddhist path.
Doctrinally, however, Abrahamic metaphysics—a Creator-God and an eternal
soul—is fundamentally incompatible with the Dhamma’s principles of
non-self (anattā) and dependent origination (paṭiccasamuppāda).

[120] This is a reference to the journey of the Greek hero Odysseus in
Homer’s The Odyssey (Book XII). Ven. Ñāṇavimala uses it to convey a
powerful Dhamma teaching: Shanaka’s note fuses two separate threats to
create a single simile for sensual craving (*kāma-sukha*): the Sirens
(who used their alluring songs to tempt sailors) and the monstrous,
flesh-eating Scylla (who caused literal death). Odysseus’s instruction
to be tied to the mast and use ear wax represents the fierce
determination (*adhiṭṭhāna*) and disciplined sense-restraint (*indriya
saṁvara sīla*) required to survive the temptation of the pleasures
(*assāda*) and avoid their resulting dangers (*ādīnava*).

[121] This likely refers to the tendency of some Buddhists to delay or
postpone effort in meditation, believing they will attain liberation
under the future Buddha, Metteyya (Maitreya). Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s point
highlights the danger of such complacency—those reborn in lower realms
will miss that opportunity entirely.

[122] This progression refers to the tenfold path of a “noble one,”
which extends beyond the standard Noble Eightfold Path. While the eighth
factor is *sammā samādhi* (Right Concentration), it is followed by
*sammā ñāṇa* (Right Knowledge) and *sammā vimutti* (Right Liberation),
which together represent the final insight and complete freedom of an
enlightened being.

[123] Ven. Ñāṇavimala explained that the deliberate effort to bring the
mind to the present moment, and even the purposeful avoidance of mental
distractions, constitutes new wholesome *kamma* (*kusala kamma*). This
intentional redirection of energy in the present moment is a powerful
action that will bear positive results, strengthening the path.

[124] *Āmisa sukha* is “worldly happiness,” the fleeting pleasure that
comes from satisfying the five senses. *Nirāmisa sukha* is “spiritual
happiness,” the more profound and stable joy that arises from
renunciation, meditation, and wisdom.

[125] *Dāna sālā* is the hall where monks gather to eat the single meal
of the day, which has been provided by lay supporters.

[126] Ven. Gnanaloka recalls that this letter was written to reassure
his worried parents, who were urging him to continue his studies. During
this period, he received many practical gems from Ven. Ñāṇavimala simply
by being in his presence—many of which are documented in Reflection 07.

[127] Ven. Gnanaloka clarifies this is a teaching on skillful
disengagement. The instruction to not “fight” a defilement is because
direct resistance, born of aversion, can paradoxically give it more
energy. The metaphor to “feed” it, or treat it like a guest, means to
calmly acknowledge its presence without alarm or self-blame. Don’t take
it too seriously, else it will grow in power. Having acknowledged it
without conflict, the practitioner does not indulge it, but skillfully
diverts it away and cultivates wholesome qualities, such as the five
spiritual faculties (*indriyas*).

[128] This refers to the *Sedaka Sutta* (SN 47.20), where the Buddha
uses a powerful simile for mindfulness. A man is commanded to carry a
bowl filled to the brim with oil through a crowd watching a beautiful
dancing woman. A guard follows with a raised sword, ready to execute him
if he spills a single drop. The Buddha explains that the bowl of oil
represents mindfulness of the body (*kāyagatāsati*), which must be
guarded with the same life-or-death urgency and unwavering attention
amidst the world’s most powerful distractions.

[129] The advice on *Mātugāma* was given to Shanaka to emphasize the
reflection on the danger (*kāma ādīnava*) of sensual attachment on his
spiritual path. This challenge, manifesting through the physical form of
the opposite sex.

[130] The “immediately calming” method points to the Bāhiya instruction:
“in the seen, just the seen; in the heard, just the heard; in the
sensed, just the sensed; in the cognized, just the cognized,” given in
*Udāna* 1.10 (*Bāhiya Sutta*); a close parallel occurs at SN 35.95
(*Māluṅkyaputta Sutta*).

[131] The complete progressive framework from understanding the
aggregates to entering the stream—the full range of insight and path
teachings in the *Saṁyutta Nikāya*.

[132] *Makhadeva Sutta* (MN 83), which tells the story of a king who,
upon seeing his first grey hair, immediately made a firm determination
to renounce the world and take up the holy life. Ven. Gnanaloka
clarifies that the teaching here is about the necessity of similarly
making a resolute determination in one’s own practice. Without such a
firm determination, one’s latent tendencies (*anusaya*) will continue to
arise and take hold. Only a practitioner who has already attained a
stage of enlightenment is considered safe from these latent tendencies.

[133] This list of *Suttas* constitutes a highly specific curriculum
designed by Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera to cultivate *sammā ñāna*
(Right Knowledge) and lead directly to the final result (*Nibbāna*). It
organizes texts crucial for developing full insight into the Four Noble
Truths.

[134] “Twelve *Suttas* is enough” means depth over breadth. Take a
small, well-chosen set, learn them thoroughly—read, memorize key lines,
reflect, practice—so study (*pariyatti*) becomes practice (*paṭipatti*)
and realization (*paṭivedha*). The point is to avoid theoretical
overload, not to forbid wider study.

[135] Arahant is a fully enlightened being.

[136] Brahma world is a celestial realm of immense peace and bliss where
beings experience extraordinarily long lifespans, free from physical
pain and gross forms of suffering.

[137] The Pāli word *saṅkhāra*—translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi as
“volitional formations,” a rendering he himself acknowledges as
imperfect—carries subtle shades of meaning depending on context. Its
essence lies in its conditioned nature: phenomena that arise dependent
on causes and conditions.

Within Dependent Origination (*paṭiccasamuppāda*), *saṅkhāra* refers to
the intentional activities rooted in ignorance that condition the
arising of consciousness that propel the round of existence. When
appearing among the five aggregates (*pañcupādānakkhandhā*), it retains
these essential characteristics but takes on a subtle contextual
difference. However, for the purpose of this reflection, it is
unessential to know this distinction in depth.

Ven. Ñāṇavimala himself steered away from elaborate definitions. Ven.
Gnanaloka encourages seekers to gain a gradual understanding through
broader readings of *Suttas* and reflection, rather than through
intellectual analysis of a term.

[138] The Pāli word for form is *rūpa.* See glossary for further
description.

[139] Anāgāmi: The third of the four stages of enlightenment; a
"Non-returner," meaning one who will not be reborn into the lower
sensual realms (which includes the human and animal worlds) before
attaining final liberation.

[140] The aircraft, an Antonov An-32B troop transport carrier, was shot
down while approaching Jaffna, killing all sixty-three people on board,
including Co-pilot Flying Officer Nihal Ranjith Fernando (Jnr.) , who at
the time was the youngest pilot in Sri Lanka to obtain a pilot’s
license. It was believed to have been struck by a surface-to-air missile
fired by the LTTE. The tragedy occurred on 22 November 1995, several
months after the outbreak of Eelam War III, the third phase of the Sri
Lankan Civil War.

[141] The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was a militant
separatist group that fought a brutal civil war (1983-2009) against the
Sri Lankan government to try and create an independent Tamil state.

[142] For a detailed account refer to ‘Pure Inspiration; Venerable
Ñāņavimala Mahāthera—Recollections Of His Life, Practice And Teachings.’

[143] The first 60 arahants refers to the Buddha’s initial disciples,
whom he immediately sent out to teach. He was leaving the comfort and
care provided by his attending supporters (*dāyakas*)—the food,
medicine, and dwellings they offered—to prioritize his mission. The
statement challenges the monk to reject the ease of dependence on the
laity in favor of the duty to teach the Dhamma.

[144] Ven. Ñāṇavimala often emphasized that while social conditions may
shift, the fundamental faith of the Sri Lankan lay community toward
sincere monks remains strong, rooted in centuries of devotion to the
Saṅgha.

[145] Ven. Ñāṇavimala’s primary warning is against the danger of sensual
pleasure (*kāmasukha*) corrupting the spiritual path. However, Venerable
Gnanaloka adds that when spiritual practitioners maintain this
disciplined, virtuous spiritual life, they naturally become figures who
inspire and lead others to follow the Dhamma.

[146] The Aranthalawa Massacre (1987): LTTE cadres kill 33 Buddhist
monks, most of them novices, in the Ampara District.

[147] The Temple of the Tooth attack (1998): The Temple of the Tooth in
Kandy, Sri Lanka’s most sacred Buddhist site housing the Buddha’s tooth
relic, was attacked by three LTTE suicide bombers driving an
explosive-laden truck.

[148] The Anuradhapura Massacre (1985): LTTE attack at the Jaya Sri Maha
Bodhi Tree, killing about 146 pilgrims at one of Sri Lanka’s most
revered Buddhist shrines.

[149] Devā/devatās are celestial beings.

[150] See Chapter 6, December 6, 1996 for this account in notes.

[151] Preceptor (Pāli: *upajjhāya*): The senior monk who gives a new
monk his higher ordination (*upasampadā*) and serves as his primary
mentor and spiritual guide. The relationship is traditionally akin to
that of a spiritual father and son.

[152] According to the Vinaya (monastic code), a monk purifies his
*sīla* (moral conduct) by formally confessing any minor transgressions
to another monk; more serious offenses require a formal meeting of the
monastic community (Saṅgha) for resolution. This act of clearing one’s
conscience is especially important when facing potential death because a
mind unburdened by guilt is more likely to be peaceful.

[153] The peace process between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE,
which began with a Ceasefire Agreement on February 22, 2002, and
officially ended on January 2, 2008, was marked by frequent violent
outbreaks, making the region dangerous throughout this period.

[154] This refers to a rule in the Vinaya, the monastic code of conduct,
which prohibits monks from traveling to or through a place where there
is active fighting.

[155] The Sri Lankan Civil War was rooted in long-standing political and
ethnic tensions between the island’s majority Sinhalese (who are
predominantly Buddhist) and the minority Tamil community. Ven. Gnanaloka
is of Sinhalese ethnicity.

[156] Ven. Gnanaloka Thero expressed this statement of gratitude to his
teacher, Venerable Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera, on the day the new *sīmā* was
opened at Parappaduwa Island Hermitage. A *sīmā* is the legally defined
boundary within which the Bhikkhu Saṅgha (Monastic Community) conducts
formal communal acts—such as higher ordination (upasampadā), the closing
of the rains-retreat, disciplinary procedures, and the annual
robe-offering ceremony (kaṭhina) to safeguard procedural purity

[157] Cārikā bhikkhus refers to monks who live the wandering ascetic
life, traveling on foot without fixed abode, depending solely on alms
and practicing meditation in solitude. Ven. Ñāṇavimala Mahāthera
encouraged the establishment of such monks to preserve the ancient
forest tradition of renunciation and simplicity. Interestingly, this
advice was given to a young monk—Ven. Bambalapitiye Gnanaloka—who had
been in robes for only two years at the time.
