It came to mind—suddenly I see this book and I feel the things people are going through. For me, it is very much about reality, about real life and what is happening to them. I hope this will play a part in removing their suffering. Otherwise, no point, you know?

Bhante's gone. I will be gone. All things pass away. Meanwhile, these teachings should help suffering go away.

My hope is that they inspire people to read the Suttas. Or protect the Suttas, maybe some good monastics, or some lay people become monastics. As lay people they will have more good supporting karma (accumulated merit). Then they will put effort and more people will find the right way. This whole thing will help, otherwise what’s the point?

That's why Buddha became Buddha. It should help their liberation, and others' liberation too.

Before going to the higher Himalayas and the deep jungles of Sri Lanka, I'd entrust these notes to an immediate attendant—to hand over to a specific devotee in case I didn't return. They moved through different hands during this time. Finally, when I wanted to get them back to give to you all—they were missing. My heart sank. I felt some attachment, some concern. I felt sorry that people wouldn't get this opportunity, these ideas. Finally, we found them—inside another cover.

Ultimately, I was waiting for a time when I could give the proper respect to Bhante. The book is one. The other is the running of the monastery, meditation retreats, ordinations and the wider spreading of the Dhamma.

This (book project) gives people a chance to follow the teachings and make them available to others. If it doesn't happen now, the opportunity is lost.

In some sense, I can see it has already happened—all of those involved in these projects. In that sense, I'm really free. Free in the sense that a weight has been lifted because there’s nothing I can regret.

How do I know? It’s that I don’t get the slightest thought about the past in regards to my duty.

Venerable Ñāṇavimala contributed so much to my spiritual path. Through him I received the living Dhamma—the noble vision that I could not have found on my own. For others who did not have that opportunity, this work will be a service for the future.

When I hold this (notes and reflections presented in this book), I feel the spirit of Venerable Ñāṇavimala.

I hope all of this helps people strive and be freed from suffering.

It's a short, fleeting moment. These things will also pass away.
